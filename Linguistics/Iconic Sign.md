An _iconic sign_ is a type of [[Sign|sign]] whose signifier is direct representation or imitation of the signified.

Iconic signs need not to be exact representations; rather, only key characteristics can be present in them.

Examples of iconic signs are:

- [[Ideophone|Ideophones]]
- [[Onomatopoeia]]

Iconicity is common in [[Sign Language|signed languages]], though there is still a considerable amount of [[Symbolic Sign|symbolism]].
