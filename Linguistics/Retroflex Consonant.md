A _retroflex consonant_ is a [[Coronal Consonant|coronal consonant]] that is articulated between the alveolar ridge and the hard palate. The tongue can be flat, concave or with the tip curled back.

Despite their name, which means _curled back_ in Latin, retroflex consonants are not necessarily articulated with the tip of the tongue curled back.
