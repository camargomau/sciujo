_Cataphora_ is the equivalent of [[Anaphora|anaphora]] for [[Postcedent|postcedents]]. That is, a cataphora is the use of an expression that depends upon a postcedent to be interpretated.

For instance, in the sentence "_Before his arrival, nobody saw Dan_", the [[Pronoun|pronoun]] _his_ refers to the postcedent _Dan_.

Both cataphora and anaphora are instances of [[Endophora|endophora]].
