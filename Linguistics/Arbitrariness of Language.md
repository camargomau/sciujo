_Arbitrariness_ is one of [[Hocket's Design Features|Hocket's design features]]. It refers to the fact that [[Language|languages]] are mostly made-up of [[Sign|signs]] where the connection between the signifier and the signified is arbirtrary (that is, [[Symbolic Sign|symbolic signs]]).

Arbitrariness is demonstrated by the fact that a same meaning can be expressed in an unlimited way across languages. This is, in my opinion, one of the [[Beauty of Language|most beautiful things about languages]].
