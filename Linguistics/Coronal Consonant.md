A _coronal consonant_ is a consonant that is articulated with the front part of the tongue. Coronals can have several articulation types:

- Apical, which use the tip of the tongue
- Laminal, which use the blade of the tongue (the part of the tongue behind the tip)
- Subapical, which use the underside of the tip of the tongue
