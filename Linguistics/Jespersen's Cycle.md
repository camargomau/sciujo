_Jespersen's cycle_ is a process formulated by linguist [[Otto Jespersen]] that describes the historical development of the construction of [[Negation|negation]] in several languages.

Jespersen's cycle can be described in 3 stages:

1. **Stage A:** negation is expressed with a single negative adverb.
2. **Stage AB:** with time, the single negative adverb is found to be insufficient and is strengthened with an additional word.
3. **Stage B:** with time, the additional word may be felt as the proper negative and the original one is then dropped. The additional word may then go through the same cycle over time.

# Examples

## French

Negation in [[French Language|French]] provides an excellent example. Let's use the phrase '_he doesn't come_':

1. **Stage A:**
	- _Ille **non** venit._ ([[Latin Language|Latin]])
	- _Il **ne** vient._ ([[Old French|Old French]])
	- At this stage in (Old) French, negations could be reinforced with certain words:
		- « _pas_ », 'step' as in « _il **ne** marche **pas**_ » ('he doesn't walk a step').
		- « _gote_ », 'drop' as in « _il **ne** boit **gote**_ » ('he doesn't drink a drop').
		- « _mie_ », 'crumb' as in « _il **ne** mange **mie**_ » ('he doesn't eat a crumb').
2. **Stage B:**
	- _Il **ne** vient **pas**._ ([[Middle French]])
	- At this stage in (Middle) French, « _pas_ » ('step') was grammaticalised as the general negation word that reinforced the previously lone « _ne_ ».
3. **Stage C:**
	- _Il vient **pas**._ (modern colloquial French)
	- In (modern colloquial) French, « _ne_ » is often dropped and « _pas_ » is used as the only negation word.

## Germanic Languages

Jespersen's cycle can also be observed in [[Germanic Languages|Germanic languages]] languages such as [[English Language|English]]. [[German Language|German]] and [[Dutch Language|Dutch]]:

1. **Stage A:**
	- \*_(Iz) **ne** kumedi._ ([[Proto-Germanic]])
	- _Er **ni** kumit (**niowiht**)._ (Late [[Old High German]])
	- _He **ne** kumet (**niewiht**)._ ([[Old Dutch]])
	- _Hē **ne** cymþ (**nāwiht**)._ ([[Old English]])
	- In these last three cases, negation could be reinforced with the word between parentheses, which meant 'not any thing'.
		- _ne_ + _io_ + _wiht_ for OHG
		- _ne + ie + wiht_ for OD
		- _ne_ + _ā_ + _wiht_ for OE
2. **Stage B:**
	- _Er **en** komt **niht**._ ([[Middle High German]])
	- _Hī **en** comt **niet**._ ([[Middle Dutch]])
	- _He **ne** cometh **naht**._ ([[Middle English]])
3. **Stage C:**
	- _Er kommt **nicht**._ (modern German)
	- _Hij komt **niet**._ (modern Dutch)
	- _He cometh **not**._ ([[Early Modern English]])

Of course, Modern English uses "_He **does** **not** come_" with an additional "_do_", which could be analysed as the repetition of Jespersen's cycle.
