In [[Rhetoric|rhetoric]], _anaphora_ is a [[Rhetorical Device|rhetorical device]] that consists of the repeated insertion of specific words at the beginning of neighbouring [[Clause|clauses]]. Anaphora is used for emphasis.

Take the following example in a portion of [[Winston Churchill]]'s famous "_We shall not fight on the beaches_" speech:

> **We shall** not flag or fail. **We shall** go on to the end. **We shall fight** in France, **we shall fight** on the seas and oceans, **we shall fight** with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, **we shall** defend our island, whatever the cost may be, **we shall fight** on the beaches, **we shall fight** on the landing grounds, **we shall fight** in the fields and in the streets, **we shall fight** in the hills. **We shall** never surrender.
