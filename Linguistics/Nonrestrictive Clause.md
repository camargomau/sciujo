A _nonrestrictive clause_ is a [[Relative Clause|relative clause]] that introduces additional information that may be omitted. Restrictive clauses simply elaborates on a noun and the information it introduces is not necessary. Restrictive clauses are delimited by commas, unlike [[Restrictive Clause|restrictive clauses]].

For instance, in the following sentences:

- I wanted to thank personally your mother, **_who_ helped me this last week**.
- The book, **_which_ quickly became popular**, has sold more than a million copies.
- He just met his brother, **John Smith**, after 20 years of hard search.

â€¦the **bold** parts indicate the nonrestrictive clause.

> [!warning]- Don't use "that"
> The [[Relative Pronoun|relative pronoun]] _that_ can be used in restrictive clauses, but do **not** use it in nonrestrictive clauses:
>
> - **Correct:** The book, **_which_** quickly became popular, has sold more than a million copies.
> - **Incorrect:** The book, **_that_** quickly became popular, has sold more than a million copies.
