A _sign_ is a combination of a specific set of forms with a specific [[Meaning|meaning]].

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] proposed in 1916 the distinction between:

- The _signifier_, the form being used
- The _signified_, the meaning being represented

For instance, the (spoken) word _cat_ is a sign because the set of [[Phoneme|phonemes]] /k/, /a/ and /t/ are forms that are used to represent the concept of a cat, the animal.

There are several types of signs:

- [[Iconic Sign|Iconic signs]]
- [[Indexical Sign|Indexical signs]]
- [[Symbolic Sign|Symbolic signs]]
