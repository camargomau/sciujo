**Topics:** [[Linguistics ]]- [[Language Learning]]

---

I very very very commonly find people that are learning a foreign language put its written form before its spoken one.

In my experience, that's not how it should be analysed. [[Writing System|Writing systems]] are a relatively recent innovation. It's the written form of the language thah wraps around the spoken one, not the other way around.

For instance, instead of asking "why is this (_written_) word **pronounced** like so?", I find it better to ask "why is this (_spoken_) word **written** like so?".

It's not that a [[Grapheme|grapheme]] represents a specific [[Phoneme|phoneme]], [[Syllable|syllable]], [[Morpheme|morpheme]] or [[Word|word]], but rather, it's these things that are represented by a grapheme.

It's best to learn a word in its spoken form then relating it to its written form.
