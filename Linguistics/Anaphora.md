_(not to be confused with [[Anaphora (Rhetoric)]])_

In [[Linguistics|linguistics]]. _anaphora_ is the use of an expression that depends upon an [[Antecedent|antecedent]] expression to be interpretated.

The term that refers to the antecedent is called the _anaphor_.

For instance, in the sentence "_Dan arrived, but nobody saw him_", the [[Pronoun|pronoun]] _him_ is an anaphor refers to the antecedent _Dan_.

Compare [[Cataphora|cataphora]], which is the use of an expression that depends upon a [[Postcedent|postcedent]]. Both anaphora and cataphora are instances of [[Endophora|endophora]].
