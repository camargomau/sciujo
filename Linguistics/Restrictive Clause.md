A _restrictive clause_ is a [[Relative Clause|relative clause]] that introduces additional information that _cannot_ be omitted. Restrictive clauses introduce necessary information about a noun, and they are not separated from the rest of the sentence by commas.

Compare [[Nonrestrictive Clause|nonrestrictive clauses]].

For instance, in the following phrases:

- The computer **_that_ I bought last year** has stopped working.
- The exam **_that_ she'll take tomorrow** will be her last one of the semester.
- The professor **_whose_ course** I failed has retired.
- The boy **_who_ you saw in the cafeteria** was my friend's brother.

â€¦the **bold** parts indicate the restrictive clause.

In restrictive clauses, the pronouns (**_in bold and italics_**) may be omitted, so that the previous phrases may become:

- The computer **I bought last year** has stopped working.
- The exam **she'll take tomorrow** will be her last one of the semester.
- The professor **course** I failed has retired.
- The boy **you saw in the cafeteria** was my friend's brother.
