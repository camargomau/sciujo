In [[English Language|English]], [[Lexical Set|lexical sets]] are used to classify groups of words that share a certain [[Vowel|vowel]] [[Phoneme|phoneme]] in a specific [[Accent|accent]].

Across various accents, the phoneme that's used in each of these sets may vary, but what's important is the fact that the phoneme is (usually) consistent in a specific one.

There are 24 standard lexical sets in English, each one identified by a specific keyword:

>[!info]- Standard Southern British Accent
> The table in this note also includes the phonemes used in a [[Standard Southern British Accent|Standard Southern British accent]], as described by [Dr. Geoff Lindsey](https://www.englishspeechservices.com/blog/british-vowels/). When compared to RP, SSB describes a more accurate representation of the English that's currently spoken in Southern England.
