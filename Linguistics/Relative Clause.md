A _relative clause_ is a [[Clause|clause]] that modifies a [[Noun|noun]] and is often introduced by a [[Relative Pronoun|relative pronoun]].

The purpose of a relative clause is to relate something previously mentioned to additional information by means of pronouns. It allows the speaker to combine two [[Independent Clause|independent clauses]] into one sentence.

There are two types of relative clauses, in English at least:

- [[Restrictive Clause|Restrictive clauses]]
- [[Nonrestrictive Clause|Nonrestrictive clauses]]
