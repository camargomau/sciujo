_Alternation_ is the phenomenon where a [[Morpheme|morpheme]] presents various phonological realisations depending on its environment. Each one of these realisations is called an _alternant_.

An example of a morpheme that presents alternation is the English morpheme for the plural, _-s_/_-es_:

- When a [[Sibilant Consonant|sibilant]] or an [[Affricate Consonant|affricate]] precedes it, it's realised as /Éªz/ (e.g. _mass**es**_ is /mas**Éªz**/)
- When a [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Consonant|consonant]] precedes it, it's realised as /s/ (e.g. _cat**s**_ is /kat**s**/)
- When a [[Voicedness|voiced]] consonant preceds it, it's realised as /z/ (e.g. _dog**s**_ is /dÉ’g**z**/)
