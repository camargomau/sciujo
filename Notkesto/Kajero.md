**Topics:** [[Notkesto]]

---

The _Kajero_ (Esperanto for "notebook") is the section of my Notkesto where I store general information; that is, where I store most of the [[Folio|Folioj]].

The Kajero aims to be mostly in French, just like [[Tagnoto|Tagnotoj]].

There is a small portion of Folioj that are kept in the [[Kursujo]] folder, inside the relevant course folder. These Folioj tend to be in Spanish, just like the Kursujo.

The Kajero resides in the aptly named _Kajero_ folder.
