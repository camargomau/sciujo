A _Temomapo_ (Esperanto for "topic map"; pl. _Temomapoj_) is a [[Gvidonoto]] that is used to link notes together according to an **overarching topic** (or category).

Temomapoj can be thought of as maps that help traverse the "terrain" that a given topic occupies within the [[Notkesto]].

[[Kursmapo|Kursmapoj]] are very similar, with their main difference being that they link the notes together according to the **course** where their topics were learned.

Temomapoj are marked by the `ðŸ—º` [[Types of Notes|type]].

# Style

Temomapoj can link to [[Scinoto|Scinotoj]] and other Temomapoj. Temomapoj may contain:

1. Lists of _links by themselves_.
2. Collections of _links glued together by prose_ (such that the relationship between the different notes is explained).

Temomapoj can have subheadings. Temomapoj can also link to external resources that are relevant to the topic.
