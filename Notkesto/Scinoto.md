A _Scinoto_ (Esperanto for "knowledge note"; pl. _Scinotoj_) is the [[Zettelkasten]]-oriented type of note of my [[Notkesto]]. All of the Scinotoj make up the [[Sciujo]].

# Features

Scinotoj have the following features:

- Scinotoj contain knowledge and thoughts (see [[Information vs. Knowledge]]).
- Scinotoj are [[Atomicity|atomic]], which means that one Scinoto contains one and only one concept/thought.
- Scinotoj are linked between each other to promote information flow, thinking, analogy-making and insight.
- Scinotoj are permanent. They are tended and taken care of, never abandoned.

Additionally, despite Spanish being my native language, all Scinotoj are written in English.

# Format

Scinotoj are made up of four parts:

1. Title. The title of a given Scinoto serves as its identifier.

2. YAML-formatted metadata. This includes (1) the title, (2) the date of creation, (3) the tags and (4) the aliases of the Scinoto.

	- _The metadata itself becomes invisible when the Scinotoj are published. Currently, only the tags are parsed by [[obsidian-html]]._

3. Topics. The single line that contains the overarching topics of a given Scinoto, in the form of linked [[Gvidonoto|Mapnotoj]], [[Pinglonoto|Pinglonotoj]] or other Scinotoj.

4. Body. The juicy bits of the Scinoto that contain the knowledge. The body may contain subheadings if necessary, but care must be taken to not violate the principle [[Atomicity|atomicity]].

# Sorting and Creation

Scinotoj are kept inside the [[Sciujo]]. They are marked by the `ðŸ§ ` [[Types of Notes|type]].

They are created from scratch, whenever needed. The information goes straight from the source to a Scinoto without an intermediate step.

If the knowledge in a Scinoto comes from a given [[Tagnoto]] or [[Kursnoto]] (e.g. a topic seen in class or some important insight), the Scinoto is linked (or embedded, in the case of Kursnotoj) within that note. That way, there's a direct _Transient note â†’ Knowledge obtained_ connection.
