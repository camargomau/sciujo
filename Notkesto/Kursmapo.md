A _Kursmapo_ (Esperanto for "course map"; pl. _Kursmapoj_) is a [[Gvidonoto]] that is used to link notes together according to the **[[Course Tag List|course]]** where they were created/modified.

Kursmapoj can be thought of as maps that help traverse all the topics seen during a given course. Kursmapoj can be useful when studying for an exam.

[[Temomapo|Temomapoj]] are very similar, but they instead link notes together according to an **overarching topic**.

Kursmapoj are marked by the `üè´` [[Types of Notes|type]].

# Style

Kursmapoj can only link to [[Scinoto|Scinotoj]]. The only Scinotoj that can be linked are the ones that were created or modified during the relevant course.

Unlike [[Temomapo|Temomapoj]], Kursmapoj can _only_ contain collections of links **glued together by prose**, such that the relationship between the different notes is always explained. This is to promote a true understanding of the knowledge involved.

Kursmapoj can have subheadings; this is especially common when dividing the different units/sections of a given course.
