A _Kursnoto_ (Esperanto for "class note", pl. _Kursnotoj_) is the type of note that is taken to (sort of) capture the knowledge and information from a given class or course.

_All_ Kursnotoj make up the [[Kursujo]], alongside _all_ [[Tasknoto|Tasknotoj]] and a few [[Folio|Folioj]].

# Features

Kursnotoj are very much like the traditional sequential notes that most people learn to take in school. However, they work very closely with [[Scinoto|Scinotoj]], and as such, have the following considerations:

1. Any concepts/knowledge that warrant a [[Scinoto]] are written down in such a Scinoto. These Scinotoj are then _embedded_ (not linked!) in the Kursnoto.
	- If only a specific section of a Noto was written, only that section is embedded.
2. Any other information that doesn't warrant a Noto (explanations, examples, too loose, etc.) is written down directly in the Kursnoto.
3. Any exercises are simply included within the rest of the note. No special treatment needed. Similarly, course information may be written down anywhere with no special treatment.

# Sorting

_All_ Kursnotoj are kept in the _Kursujo_ Folder, inside the corresponding course folder.

They are titled "_yyyy-mm-dd, \[Topic] (\[[[Course Tag List|Course Acronym]]])_", according to the main topic and the date they were created.

Kursnotoj are marked by the `ðŸ“š` [[Types of Notes|type]].
