The _Notkesto_ (Esperanto for "notebox") is my set of notes. I use my Notkesto as a personal tool for thinking, personal growth, knowledge-storing and information-storing.

I use the amazing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write and manage all these notes.

The Notkesto is made up of 4 sections:

- [[Sciujo]] - knowledge
- [[Kajero]] - information
- [[Kursujo]] - courses (learning)
- [[Taglibro]] - diary

The Sciujo is the only section that's public and it's what you're reading right now. I publish these notes thanks to [[obsidian-html]].

Every concept pertaining to my Notkesto (sections, note types, folders, etc.) has a name in Esperanto. Why? Just because I'm a language nerd and because Esperanto words have a certain aesthetic I love.

Throughout the Notkesto, I use several types of notes:

- [[Scinoto|Scinotoj]]
- [[Gvidonoto|Gvidonotoj]]
- [[Folio|Folioj]]
- [[Vortonoto|Vortonotoj]]
- [[Kursnoto|Kursnotoj]]
- [[Tasknoto|Tasknotoj]]
- [[Tagnoto|Tagnotoj]]

I also use [[Types of Notes|specific tags]] for various purposes, mainly for indicating the type of each note.
