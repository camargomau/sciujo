A _Tasknoto_ (Esperanto for "assignment note"; pl. _Tasknotoj_) is the type of note that is meant to contain (homework) assignments for a given course.

I use these notes for smaller and less important homework assignments that can be quickly done in Obsidian. Larger and more important assignments are, for example, better off in dedicated LaTeX documents.

_All_ Tasknotoj reside in the [[Kursujo]], alongside _all_ [[Kursnoto|Kursnotoj]] and a few [[Folio|Folioj]].

# Sorting

Just like Kursnotoj, _all_ Tasknotoj are kept in the Kursujo folder, inside the corresponding course folder.

They are marked by the `ðŸ“‘` [[Types of Notes|type]].
