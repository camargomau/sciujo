A _Folio_ (Esperanto for "sheet"; pl. _Folioj_) is the general purpose type of note. Folioj can be used to write down anything that doesn't belong to any of the other [[Types of Notes|types of notes in the Notkesto]].

They are generally used for writing down information that might be useful later, for whatever purpose.

# Sorting

The vast majority of Folioj are kept in the [[Kajero]]. A small portion of them, those that contain information relevant for a given course, are kept in the [[Kursujo]] folder, inside the relevant course folder.

Folioj are marked by the `ðŸ“„` [[Types of Notes|type]].
