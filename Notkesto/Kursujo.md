**Topics:** [[Notkesto]]

---

The _Kursujo_ (Esperanto for "course container") is the section of my Notkesto that contains all the notes that I take during my classes and courses.

Notes in the Kursujo can be [[Kursnoto|Kursnotoj]], [[Tasknoto|Tasknotoj]] or [[Folio|Folioj]].

Every note in the Kursujo is _fleeting_ in the sense that it's (consistently) useful at most for the duration of the course. The actual knowledge obtained during courses resides in the [[Sciujo]].

While the Kursujo isn't published, its content can be shared when necessary, since it's not strictly personal.

The Kursujo resides in the aptly named _Kursujo_ folder.
