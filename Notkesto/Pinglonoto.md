A _Pinglonoto_ (Esperanto for "pin note"; pl. _Pinglonotoj_) is a [[Gvidonoto]] that is created just to make it show up in Graph view in a different colour than the default light-grey that Obsidian uses for inexistent notes.

Pinglonotoj can be seen as precursors to [[Temomapo|Temomapoj]]. When enough [[Scinoto|Scinotoj]] link to a given Pinglonotoj, it can be promoted to a Temomapo.

Pinglonotoj are marked by the `üìç` [[Types of Notes|type]].
