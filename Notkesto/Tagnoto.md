A _Tagnoto_ (Esperanto for "day note"; pl. _Tagnotoj_) is a note that is used to capture daily thoughts and ideas, along with a general summary of the work that was done within the [[Notkesto]] during the day.

Tagnotoj aim to be mostly in French. Tagnotoj are separated in several sections:

- **Arbres** (_Trees_): here's where I add a link to every [[Scinoto]] that was created or edited during the day.

- **VÃ©los** (_Bicycles_): this is where I add a link to every [[Kursnoto]] that was created during the day.

- **Introspection** (_Insight_): this is where I write any important _personal_ insight that I came up with during the day. Non-personal insight or ideas go in [[Scinoto|Scinotoj]].

- **Journal** (_Journal_): this section is the heart of Tagnotoj, where I write how I'm feeling, what I've done in the day, or just about anything that comes to mind and want to write down. This section can have subheadings when I've had a long day or have several topics to talk about.

The only section that shows up in every single Tagnoto is **Journal**. The rest only show up when needed.

At the top of every Tagnoto, there's a **Souvenir** table that contains links to older Tagnotoj in 6-month increments (i.e. 6 months ago, 1 year ago, 18 months ago, etc.) and a link to the [last.fm scrobbles](https://last.fm/user/PsycakePancake) I made during that specific day. These links are automatically added by [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater).

Tagnotoj are marked by the `ðŸ“†` [[Types of Notes|type]].
