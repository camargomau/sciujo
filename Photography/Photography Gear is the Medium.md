It can be easy to care more about photography gear than the art itself (see [[Photography is More About Art than Technology]]), but ultimately it's important to realise that **the gear is just the medium**.

The gear is the medium that we use to record our vision. It's what allows us to take that photo, _the true goal_.

Having great gear can be fulfilling and help us create better photos (technically, at least), but one must be cautious as to not let it distract us from what we're actually capturing, the final product.
