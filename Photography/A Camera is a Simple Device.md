Think about it: a camera is actually a **very simple device**. It's simply a device that can record light by focusing light on a photosensitive surface.

It consists of three parts:

- The [[Photosensitive Surface|photosensitive surface]], which records the light that incides on it.
- The [[Camera Lens|lens]], which focuses the light on the photosensitive surface.
- The [[Camera Body|body]], which puts it all together and is light-sealed so that just the light that wants to be captured gets in.
