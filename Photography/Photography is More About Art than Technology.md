**Topics:** [[Photography]]

With all the photography gear that's available nowadays, and the way it's pushed by manufacturers, it may be easy to fall into the trap of thinking that technology and gear are all that there is to photography. It may be easy to think that the latest technology is key for a good photo.

It's not.

While good gear certainly helps, **photography is more about art** than technology. Understanding gear can lead to technically good photos, but _great photos_ that touch the viewer need also an understanding of the artistic side of photography.

Remember: [[Photography Gear is the Medium|gear is the medium]].
