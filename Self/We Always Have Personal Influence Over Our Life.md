It's true. We can't always control what happens to us, and trying to control everything around our lives will only make things harder for ourselves. We can't be responsible for any of that.

However, we _are_ responsible for the way we react to that. We do have control over what we think and do about it. 

It's about knowing that _**we always have a certain amount of personal influence over our life**_. We can't do much about what we can't control, but we can do *a lot* about what we can. 

We should not see [[Life Circumstances are Growth Opportunities|our life circumstances as obstacles, but rather, as growth opportunities]].
