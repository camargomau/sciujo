**Topics:** [[Self]]

I frequently fall into the trap of forming a perception of myself that is built upon the way others perceive me. However, with time, I have learnt that this is just not the best of ideas.

[[How Others Perceive Me Also Depends on Them|How others perceive me also depends on them]] and [[I Am Not Responsible for How Others Perceive Me|I am not (fully) responsible for how they perceive me]], so why let them have control over how _I_ perceive _myself_?

Sure, we are social beings, so naturally my perception of others and the impact I have on them is an important thing to consider, but my self-identity shouldn't be based entirely on who other people _think_ I am or what they _think_ I do or what they expect from me.

**I am the only person that can fully determine who I am, what I do and what I stand for.**
