When wanting to make changes in our lives, it may be easy to think that the way to do it is to "go big or go home". We may think the only way to truly achieve change is to take big actions overnight.

However, with time and experience, I have noticed that the best way to achieve change is the complete opposite. Rome wasn't built in a day. You can't go from 0 to 100 in one day, one week or even one month.

I have found that the most effective way to achieve change is to take small actions everyday. While these small actions may seem insignificant or even useless on a day to day basis, they _compound_ over time. From one day to the other, you may not notice significant change, but when you look back a month or a year, that's when you see true progress.

**Who we are is not the result of big changes we make at various points in our lives, but rather, it's the result of small changes we make on a day to day basis.**

[[Habits are Built By Getting Used to the Habit First|Building habits by getting used to them first]] is an excellent example of this principle in practice.
