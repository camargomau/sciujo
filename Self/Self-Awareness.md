Self-awareness is the ability to understand one's own thoughts, emotions and behaviours, and how they impact others.

Self-awareness allows us to be more conscious of our actions and to understand our strengths and weaknesses. This helps us take better decisions, build stronger relationships, communicate better and be more empathetic to others.
