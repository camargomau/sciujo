In an age so full of distractions, stimulation and diversions, it can be rare to find ourselves bored. We no longer tolerate boredom: the second we're bored, we instantly seek stimulation from things like our phones, TV or social media.

Truth is, boredom isn't a bad thing. Boredom shouldn't always be suppressed. As I started getting into the habit of not using my phone all the time, I started to have more moments of boredom. I decided to embrace these moments of boredom as part of the process, and eventually found that they _are_ actually one of the benefits.

Moments of boredom let our thoughts flow freely. They let us ponder and consider, which ultimately leads us to creative new insights or ideas.
