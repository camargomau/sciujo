**Topics:** [[Self-Awareness]] - [[Mindfulness]]

When I got more into [[Mindfulness|mindfulness]], I started noticing that [[Overthinking is Seldom About Reality]]. Once I realised that, I started to see that the key to stopping overthinking was to identify when my thoughts started to drift away from reality so that I could ground them back (or completely stop thinking about the topic at hand).

This is one of the many ways in which [[Meditation|meditation]] can help: it trains us to identify our thoughts and then to move out focus away from them.
