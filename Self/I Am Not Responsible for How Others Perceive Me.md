The way others perceive me isn't my responsibility. Sure, who I am, what I do and the impact I have on others is important, but in the end, that only determines how I come across and not how other people perceive that.

How other perceive me also depends on things that I _cannot_ control. It can depend, for example, on their mood, their life experiences, the type of people they are used to hanging out with, etc. There's a ton of things about other people that I have nothing to do with. More importantly, [[Other People Don't Know Me as Well as I Do|other people don't know me as well as I do]], so the way they perceive me only depends on **_what_ they see and _how_ they see it**.

This is why I cannot let [[Others' Perception of Me Doesn't Define Who I Am|others' perception of me define who I am]]. If I'm comfortable with who I am, do good and am happy with what I do, then what's to worry?
