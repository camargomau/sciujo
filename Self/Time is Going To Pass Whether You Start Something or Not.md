When we want to start doing something (e.g. a [[Habit|habit]]) and, for any reason, we think we're starting it later than we should have, we might want to abandon the idea altogether. We might think we'll fail at it again, we might think it's not worth it after all, we might think we'll start seeing progress too late.

In those cases, the best is to _stop thinking and just do it_. Whether you start doing it or not, time is going to pass anyway. Whatever you do, you can't stop the passage of time, so you might as well do it, right?
