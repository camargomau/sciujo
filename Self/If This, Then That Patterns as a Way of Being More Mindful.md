When getting into [[Mindfulness|mindfulness]] and [[Emotional Intelligence|emotional intelligence]], I found it very useful to start including little actions of mindfulness throughout my day.

For instance, when getting angry at something, instead of letting the feelings accumulate and control me, I would instead _take a few deep breaths_, then ask myself if getting angry would actually serve a purpose or if it's just a reflex.

When getting anxious over something, instead of running away from it, I would _take a few deep breaths_ and ask myself if it really was something that should make me anxious or if it's just a reflex.

These are basically _if this, then that_ patterns, where "that" is always an action that encourages mindfulness.

By consistently implementing these patterns throughout the day, we teach the brain to frequently shift into a mindful state of mind, strengthening the intentional parts of the brain (and weakening the impulsive ones). 

These patterns are examples of simple, easily-repeatable actions that can lead to bigger changes, so [[Habits are Built By Getting Used to the Habit First|they are an excellent way of getting used to the habit of mindfulness]]. Indeed, we are [[Focus on the Habit Cue, not the Behaviour|focusing on the cue, not the behaviour]].
