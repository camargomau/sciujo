**Topics:** [[Habit]]

---

When wanting to create a new [[Habit|habit]] or get rid of an old one, we might be naturally inclined to focus on the behaviour itself. We think "oh, this is good so I should find a way to make it a habit" or "this is bad so I should find a way to stop doing it".

However, I have found that our habit building becomes more effective when we **focus on the cue** that triggers the behaviour, and not the behaviour itself.
