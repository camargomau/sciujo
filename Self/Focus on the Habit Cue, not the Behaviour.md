**Topics:** [[Habit]]

When wanting to create a new [[Habit|habit]] or get rid of an old one, we might be naturally inclined to focus on the behaviour itself. We think "oh, this is good so I should find a way to make it a habit" or "this is bad so I should find a way to stop doing it".

However, I have found that our habit building becomes more effective when we **focus on the cue** that triggers the behaviour, and not the behaviour itself.

<% tp.file.cursor(3) %>A **[[Stochastic Process|stochastic process]] with independent increments** is a stochastic process where, for any $0 < t_{1} < t_{2} < \dots < t_{n}$ [[Parameter Set|parameters]], the variables $X_{t_{1}}, X_{t_{2}} - X_{t_{1}}, X_{t_{3}} - X_{t_{2}}, \dots , X_{t_{n}} - X_{t_{n-1}}$ are [[Event Independence|independent]].

Examples of stochastic processes with independent increments include [[Homogeneous Poisson Process|homogeneous Poisson processes]].
