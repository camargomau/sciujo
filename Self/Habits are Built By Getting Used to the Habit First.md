Good and effective [[Habit|habits]] can't be built overnight. It's unrealistic to want to form a habit, and have it be productive and consistent by the next day, or even by the next week or month.

A good way to build a habit is to first get used to the activity. Everyday, do something related to the activity, _doesn't matter how big or small, how effective, or how good you're at it_. The point is to just do something related to it so that it's ingrained as something that has to be done every day. Don't worry about visible changes, they'll come eventually. Don't worry about creating the perfect plan, that'll also come eventually.

Once the habit is automatic, you can move onto the next step, which is continuing with the habit but being more productive with it. Now that you don't have to worry about sticking to the habit (since it's already automatic), you can focus on actually making it work; you can now focus on getting good at it.
