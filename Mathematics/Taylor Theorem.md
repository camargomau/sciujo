**Topics:** [[Calculus]] - [[Taylor Polynomial]]

Let $f : [a, x] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a [[Function]] $C_{n+1}$ (i.e. [[Continuous Function|continuous]] $n+1$ times; [[Differentiability|differentiable]] $n+1$ times).

We define _the remainder_ as:
$$
R_{n, a}(x) := f(x) - \left(f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \dots + \frac{f^n (a) (x-a)^n}{n!} \right)
$$
That is, the remainder is the function minus its degree $n$ [[Taylor Polynomial|Taylor polynomial]].

Furthermore, we can represent the remainder in the following forms:

1. **Lagrange form:** for some $t \in (a, x),$

$$
R_{n, a}(x) = \frac{f^{n+1}(t)}{n!} (x-t)^n (x-a)
$$

1. **Cauchy form:** for some $t \in (a, x)$,

$$
R_{n, a}(x) = \frac{f^{n+1}(t)}{(n+1)!} (x-a)^{n+1}
$$

1. **Integral form:**

$$
R_{n, a}(x) = \int_a^x \frac{f^{n+1}(t)}{n!} (x-t)^n\ dt
$$
