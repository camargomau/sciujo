_**(definition)**_

Let $A$ be a [[Set|set]]. We define the _partition of a set_ $A$ (denoted $P$) such that it's true that:

1. The elements of $P$ are non-empty subsets of $A$
2. The [[Union|union]] of the elements of $P$ is $A$
3. The [[Intersection|intersection]] of any pair of elements of $P$ is empty

> [!example]- Example 1
> Let $2 \mathbb{Z} = \{2n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ and $\Pi = \{2n+1 \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.
>
> Both of these sets form a partition of $\mathbb{Z}$:
>
> $$
> P = \{2 \mathbb{Z}, \Pi\}
> $$

> [!example]- Example 2
> Let $D = \{0, 1, \dots, 9\}$. This set has the partitions:
>
> $$
> P_{1} = \{ \{0,1\}, \{2,3,7\}, \{5,9\}, \{4,6\}, \{8\}\}
> $$
>
> $$
> P_{2} = \{ \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}, \{6\}, \{7\},\{8\}, \{9\} \}
> $$
>
> Those are just two instances of partitions of $D$. It can have other partitions.
