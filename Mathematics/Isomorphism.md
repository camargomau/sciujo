When a [[Linear Transformation|linear transformation]] $T : V \rightarrow W$ is [[Bijective Linear Transformations|bijective]], we call it an _isomorphism_.

We say that $V$ and $W$ are _isomorphic_ if there exists a $T$ between them that's an isomorphism. We denote this by $V \cong W$.

# Inverse of T

If $T : V \rightarrow W$ is an isomorphism, then $T^{-1} : W \rightarrow V$ (the [[Inverse Linear Transformation|inverse]]) is also an isomorphism.

# Dimension and Isomorphism

Let $V, W$ be [[Vector Space|vector spaces]] on $\mathbb{K}$ with a finite [[dimension]]. Then, the following statements are equivalent:

1. $\dim(V) = dim(W) = n$
2. $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic

For instance, if $V$ is a vector space on $\mathbb{K}$ such that $dim(V) = n$, then $V \cong \mathbb{K}^n$.
