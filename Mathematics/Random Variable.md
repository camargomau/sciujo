_**(definition)**_

A _random variable_ $X$ is a [[Measurable Function|measurable function]] $X : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ ($\Omega$ a [[Sample Space|sample space]]) where, given any [[Set|set]] $B$:

$$
X^{-1}(B) \in \mathscr{F}
$$

â€¦or also:

$$
\left\{ w \in \Omega \mid X(w) \leq x \right\} \in \mathscr{F}
$$

â€¦where $\mathscr{F}$ is a [[Ïƒ-Algebra|sigma-algebra]].

In other words, a random variable is a mapping from the possible outcomes in the sample space to a measurable space (in this case $\mathbb{R}$).

As such, in general, we can see a random variable as the mathematical formalisation of quantities or objects that depend on randomness.

# Types

There are two types of random variables:

- [[Discrete Random Variable|Discrete random variables]]
- [[Absolutely Continuous Random Variable|Absolutely continuous random variables]]

For both of these, we can define a [[Density Function|density function]], which helps us specify the probability of the random variable being a certain value or being in a given interval.
