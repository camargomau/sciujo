_**(definition)**_

Two [[Subgraph|subgraphs]] $g_1$ and $g_2$ of a [[Graph|graph]] $G$ are said to be _edge-disjoint subgraphs_ (or _edge-separate subgraphs_) if they don't share any [[Edge|edges]].

Edge disjoint subgraphs may share [[Vertex|vertices]].

There are also [[Vertex-Disjoint Subgraphs|vertex-disjoint subgraphs]].
