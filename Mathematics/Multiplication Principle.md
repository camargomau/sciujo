The _multiplication principle_ is a basic [[Counting Principle|counting principle]].

Intuitively, it tells us that if we have two sets of $k$ and $n$ elements respectively, and we want to choose two elements such that one is from the first set **and** the other from the second one, then we can do so in $kn$ ways.

Mathematically, if $A$ and $B$ are two finite sets, then:

$$
|A \times B| = |A||B|
$$
