_**(definition)**_

A _vector-valued [[Function|function]] $\textbf r(t)$_ is a mapping from its [[Domain|domain]] $D \subset \mathbb{R}$ to its [[Range|range]] $R \subset V_3$ (a [[Vector Space|vector space]] of [[Dimension|dimension]] 3), so that for each $t$ in $D$, $\textbf r(t) = v$ for exactly one vector $v \in R$.

We can write a vector-valued function as:

$$
\textbf r(t) = f(t)\textbf i + g(t)\textbf j + h(t)\textbf k
$$

â€¦for some scalar functions $f$, $g$ and $h$ (called the component functions of $r$).

> [!tip]- $\textbf{i, j, k}$ and the basis
> Remember that, in this case, the [[Basis|basis]] of $V_3$ is $\{ \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k} \}$. As such, we are writing $\textbf r(t)$ as a [[Linear Combination|linear combination]] of the vectors in this basis.

> [!info]- Normal vs. Vector-Valued Function Graphs
> Notice that a graph generated by a vector-valued function differs from the one generated by a normal function in that the former doesn't include its domain, while the latter does. The graph of a vector-valued function is traced in its counterdomain.
