**Topics:** [[Integral Transform]]

_**(definition)**_

The **Laplace transform** is an [[Integral Transform|integral transform]] defined as:

$$
\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} := \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \ dt = F(s)
$$

We can easily obtain the [[Laplace Transform of Simple Functions|Laplace transform various simple functions]]. We can prove [[Fundamental Theorems of the Laplace Transform|several fundamental theorems for Laplace transforms]]. 

We can easily obtain the Laplace transform of a [[Piecewise Function|piecewise function]] by first [[Expressing a Piecewise Function with Shifted Unit Step Functions|rewriting the piecewise function in terms of shifted unit step functions]], then applying one of the previously mentioned fundamental theorems (see the corresponding note).

We can assure the [[Laplace Transform Conditions of Existence|existence of a Laplace transform through the consequences of various theorems]].
