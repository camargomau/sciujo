_**(definition)**_

In the context of a [[Markov Chain|Markov chain]], the **first-passage time** is the minimum amount of transitions that are necessary to go from one [[State Set|state]] to another _for the first time_. 

Compare to the [[Recurrence Time|recurrence time]], which is the minimum amount of steps needed to _return_ to a given state (for the first time, too).

We can obtain the [[C Scio/Mathematics/Average First-Passage Time|average first-passage time]] for a given state when starting at another given state.
