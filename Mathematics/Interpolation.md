In the field of numerical analysis, given a set of known data points, _interpolation_ is the process of estimating other unknown data points within the set's range.

In other words, to interpolate is to estimate unknown data points between other known points.

Interpolation methods include using using [[Taylor Polynomial|Taylor polynomials]], using [[Lagrange Polynomial|Lagrange polynomials]] and [[Newton's Finite Differences Interpolation Method|Newton's finite differences interpolation method]].
