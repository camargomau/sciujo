_**(definition)**_

In a set of observations of a [[Variable (Statistics)|variable]], the _mode_ is the value that is repeated _the most_.

Mode only exists for [[Quantitative Variable|quantitative variables]].

# Special Cases

## Every Value

When every value is repeated the same amount of times, the mode doesn't exist.

For example, the mode of $\left\{  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \right\}$ doesn't exist.

## More Than One

When two values are repeated the same amount of times and they are consecutive, the mode is the average of those two values.

For example, the mode of $\left\{ 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6 \right\}$ is $4.5$.

When two or more values are repeated the same amount of times and they are not consecutive, the mode is each of those values.

For example, the mode of $\left\{ 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6 \right\}$ is $3$ and $6$.

# Random Variables

_**(theorem)**_

Let $X$ be a [[Random Variable|random variable]] whose [[Density Function|density function]] $f_{X}(x)$ we know.

We can find $X$'s mode by finding the [[Local Extremum|local maximums]] of $f_{X}(x)$.
