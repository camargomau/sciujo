**Topics:** [[Probability]] - [[Random Variable]]

_**(definition)**_

Let $X$ be a real [[Random Variable|random variable]] whose [[Range of a Function|range]] is $R_X$.

A density function is a function that allows us to specify the probability of $X$ being a specific value (in the discrete case) or of $X$ falling within a particular range of values (in the continuous case, though indirectly, as you'll see below).

# Discrete Random Variables

When $X$ is a [[Discrete Random Variable|discrete random variable]], we define the _density function_ of $X$ as the [[Function|function]] $f_X : R_X \subset \mathbb{R} \to [0, 1]$ as:

$$
f_X(x) =
\begin{cases}
\mathbb{P}(X = x) & \text{if } x \in R_X \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

 â€¦and the following must hold:

1. $$0 \leq f_X(x) \leq 1$$
2. $$\sum_{x \in R_X} f_X(x) = 1$$

The density function of a _discrete_ random variable does tell us the probability that the random variable takes _exactly_ a _specific_ value.

The density function of a discrete random variable is also called a _mass function_.

When $X$ is an [[Absolutely Continuous Random Variable|absolutely continuous random variable]], we define the _density function_ of $X$ as the [[Function|function]] $f_X : R_X \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}_+ = [0, \infty)$ as:

$$
f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
\text{a function} & \text{if } x \in \text{relevant interval} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

 â€¦and the following must hold:

1. $$f_X \geq 0$$

2. $$\int_{\mathbb{R}} f_X(x)\ dx = 1$$

Many times, when simply saying _density function_, an absolutely continuous random variable is implied (with the discrete case using _mass function_).
