**Topics:** [[Probability]]

If we add additional information to an [[Experiment|experiment]], we change the [[Probability of an Event|probability of the event]].

_**(definition)**_

Let $A, B$ be [[Event|events]] such that $\mathbb{P}(B) > 0$.

We define the _conditional probability_ of the event $A$, **given** (i.e. knowing, supposing, assuming) the occurrence of the event $B$, as follows:

$$
\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) := \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}
$$

$\mathbb{P}(A \mid B)$ is read "the probability of $A$ given $B$".

> \mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \frac{\frac{10}{36}}{\frac{30}{36}} = \frac{10}{30}= \frac{1}{3}

_**(theorem)**_

Conditional probability is a [[Probability Measure|probability measure]].
