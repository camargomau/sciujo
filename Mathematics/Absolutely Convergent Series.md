_**(definition)**_

We say that a [[Series|series]] $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is _absolutely convergent_ if and only if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty | a_n |$ converges.

_**(theorem)**_

If $\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent, then it's also convergent.

If the series of the absolute values of the negative terms and the series of the positive terms are convergent, then $\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent.

# Leibniz Theorem

_**(theorem)**_

Suppose that $a_1 \geq a_2 \geq a_3 \geq \dots \geq 0$, and that $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0$.

Then, $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1} a_n = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \dots$ converges.
