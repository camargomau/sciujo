_**(definition)**_

In the _frequentist approach of probability_, for $A$ an [[Event|event]] and an [[Experiment|experiment]] that is carried out $n$ times, we define its frequency as:

$$
f^{n}(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n}
$$

â€¦where $n(A)$ denotes the number of times that $A$ occurs.

# Properties

Note that:

- $f^{n}(A) \in [0, 1]$
- $f^{n}(\Omega) = 1$
- $f^{n}(A \cup B) = f^{n}(A) + f^{n}(B)$
