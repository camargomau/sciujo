**Topics:** [[Path]] - [[Graph Theory]]

There are several types of [[Path|paths]]:

- An _open path_ is a path that ends on a vertex different from the one that it starts on. A _closed path_ is the opposite: it starts and ends on the same vertex.

- A [[Simple Trajectory|simple trajectory]] is an open path with no repeated vertices or edges.

- A [[Circuit|circuit]] is a closed path with no repeated edges and just one repeated vertex (the start/end vertex).

- A _directed path_ is a path that respects the direction of the [[Arc|arcs]] it goes through.
