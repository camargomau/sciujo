_**(definition)**_

We say that a collection of [[Random Variable|random variables]] is _independent and identically distributed_ when every one of them has the same [[Probability Distribution|distribution]] (i.e. the same [[Density Function|density function]]) and they're all mutually [[Event Independence|independent]].

Independent and identically distributed random variables are often abbreviated as simply _iid_ random variables.
