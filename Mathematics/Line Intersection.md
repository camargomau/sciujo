Let $l_1$ and $l_2$ be two [[Line|lines]] in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

We say $l_1$ and $l_2$ intersect on a point if they are different lines if there exists a point $R \in \mathbb{R}^3$ such that:

$$
l_1 \cap l_2 = \{ R \}
$$

# Procedure

Given two lines in its general [[Line#Vectorial Representation|vectorial representation]]:

$$
l_1 = \{ (P_1, P_2, P_3) + t(u_1, u_2, u_3) \mid t \in \mathbb{R} \}
$$

$$
l_2 = \{ (Q_1, Q_2, Q_3) + s(v_1, v_2, v_3) \}
$$

We can find their intersection by making them equal. This is the equation from where we start:

$$
(P_1, P_2, P_3) + t(u_1, u_2, u_3) = (Q_1, Q_2, Q_3) + s(v_1, v_2, v_3)
$$

With that, we get the system with two variables $t$ and $s$:

$$
\begin{cases}
P_1 + tu_1 = Q_1 + sv_1 \\
P_2 + tu_2 = Q_2 + sv_2 \\
P_3 + tu_3 = Q_3 + sv_3
\end{cases}
\implies
\begin{cases}
tu_1 - sv_1 = -P_1 + Q_1 \\
tu_2 - sv_2 = -P_2 + Q_2 \\
tu_3 - sv_3 = -P_3 + Q_3
\end{cases}
$$

Solving this system gives us the intersection of the two lines. We can get three cases:

1. There is one and only one solution $\implies$ the lines intersect ([[Two Line Cases|case 3]])
2. There are no solutions $\implies$ the lines never intersect
	- The lines _could_ be [[Parallel Lines|parallel]] or not ([[Two Line Cases|case 2]] or [[Two Line Cases|case 4]])
3. There are infinite solutions $\implies$ the lines are actually the same line (i.e. they intersect everywhere; [[Two Line Cases|case 1]])
