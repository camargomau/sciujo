_**(definition)**_

In [[Statistics|statistics]], a _parameter_ is a numerical characterisation of a [[Population|population]] that describes partially or completely its [[Probability Distribution|probability distribution]] ([[Density Function|density function]]).

For instance, in a population that follows a [[Normal Distribution|normal distribution]] $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^{2})$, both $\mu$ and $\sigma^{2}$ serve as parameters, that describe the population's [[Expected Value|expected value]] and [[Variance|variance]], respectively.
