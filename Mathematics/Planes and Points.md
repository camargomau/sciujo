[[Plane|Planes]] and [[Point|points]] can be related in several ways.

# Plane that Passes Through the Origin

When $P = (0, 0, 0)$ (the [[origin]]), then the plane takes the vectorial representation:

$$
\Pi := \{ tu + sv : t, s \in \mathbb{R} \}
$$

We call this the plane that passes through the origin and is generated by the vectors $u$ and $v$.

# Does a Point Exist in a Plane?

To see if $q = (q_1, q_2, q_3)$ is in a given plane $\Pi = \{ P + tu + sv : t, s \in \mathbb{R} \}$, then we can try to solve the equation system:

$$
\begin{cases}
q_1 = P_1 + su_1 + tv_1 \\
q_2 = P_2 + su_2 + tv_2 \\
q_3 = P_3 + su_3 + tv_3
\end{cases}
$$
(remember we can write $\Pi = \{ P_1 + su_1 + tv_1, P_2 + su_2 + tv_2, P_3 + su_3 + tv_3) : t, s \in \mathbb{R})$)

If the system can be solved, then the point exists in the plane. If it can't be solved, then it doesn't exist in the plane.

# Plane that Passes Through 3 Points

Given 3 points $p=(x_1, y_1, z_1)$, $q = (x_2, y_2, z_2)$, $r = (x_3, y_3, z_3)$, we can find the plane that passes through these three points by doing the following:

1. Choosing one point as the _base_ point. Let's say we choose $p$
2. Calculating the direction vectors by subtracting the base point from the other points:
	- $u = r-p = p-r$
	- $v = q-p = p-q$
3. We can use the base point and these two vectors to represent the plane that passes through these three points
