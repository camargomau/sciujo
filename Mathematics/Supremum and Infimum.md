_**(definition)**_

Let $(X, \preceq)$ be a [[Partially Ordered Set|poset]] and let $B \subseteq X$

- The _supremum_ of $B$ ($\sup_{x}(B)$) is the minimum [[Upper and Lower Bounds|upper bound]] of $B$
- The _infimum_ of $B$ ($\inf_{x}(B)$) is the maximum [[Upper and Lower Bounds|lower bound]] of $B$

> [!warning] Not Necessarily in the Set
> The supremum and the infimum of a given set aren't necessarily in that set.

The supremum and infimum help us define [[Lattice|lattices]].
