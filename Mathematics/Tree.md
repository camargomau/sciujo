_**(definition)**_

A _tree_ is a [[Connected Graph|connected graph]] with no [[Circuit|circuits]]. A set of trees is called a [[Forest|forest]].

> [!question] How to identify a tree?
> A [[Graph|graph]] $G = (V, E)$ in which there is a unique path between every pair of vertices is a tree.
>
> A graph $G = (V, E)$ such that $|E| = |V| - 1$ that has no circuits is a tree.

There are [[Types of Trees|various types of trees]].

Trees can have various [[Leaf Vertex|leaf]] and [[Branch Vertex|branch vertices]], but they may only have one [[Centre of a Tree|centre vertex]] and one [[Root Vertex|root vertex]].

Trees have a [[Height of Tree|height]].

# Properties

- In a tree, there exists a [[Path|path]] between any two [[Vertex|vertices]].
- A tree with one or more [[Vertex|vertices]] has at least a [[Leaf Vertex|leaf vertex]].
