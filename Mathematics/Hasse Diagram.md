When we represent a [[Partially Ordered Set|poset]] $(X, \preceq)$ with a [[Digraph|digraph]], we can simplify it by:

1. Removing all loops (i.e. remove all the arrows given by the [[Properties of Relations|reflexive property]])
2. Removing all the arrows that are given by the [[Properties of Relations|transitive property]]
3. Removing the direction of every arrow

The resulting diagram is called a _Hasse diagram_.
