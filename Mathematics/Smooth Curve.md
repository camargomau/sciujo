_**(definition)**_

We say that the [[Curve|curve]] traced out by the [[Vector-Valued Function|vector-valued function]] $r(t) = \langle r_1(t), r_2(t), \dots, r_n(t) \rangle$ on an [[Interval|interval]] $l$ is _smooth_ if $r'(t)$ (its [[Derivative of a Vector-Valued Function|derivative]]) is [[Continuous Vector-Valued Function|continuous]] on $l$ and $r'(t) \neq 0$, except possibly at any endpoints of $l$.

> [!info]- Not All Zeroes
> Notice that this says that the curve is smooth provided $r_1'(t), r_2'(t), \dots, r_n'(t)$ are all continuous on $l$, but they are _not all zero_ at the same point in $l$.
