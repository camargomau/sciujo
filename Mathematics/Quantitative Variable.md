In statistics, a _quantitative variable_ is a [[Variable (Statistics)|variable]] that describes quantities, instead of [[Qualitative Variable|qualities]].

Of course, quantitative variables can be discrete or continuous, depending on the set where they take values.

In [[Descriptive Statistics|descriptive statistics]], quantitative variables can be:

- _Of ratio_, where there is a definite starting point (e.g. height, distance)
- _Of interval_, where a starting point can't be defined or there can be negative values (e.g. time, temperature, etc.)

> [!example]- Examples
> Examples of quantitative variables are:
>
> - The lifespan of a light bulb, measured in seconds (continuous of ratio)
> - The amount of children in a family (discrete of ratio)
> - The amount of people in a family (discrete of ratio)
> - The weight of a person in kilograms (continuous of ratio)
