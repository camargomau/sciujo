_**(definition)**_

The _divergence_ of a [[Vector Field|vector field]] $F(x,y,z) = \langle F_1(x,y,z), F_2(x,y,z), F_3(x,y,z) \rangle$ is the scalar [[Function|function]]:

$$
\text{div}\ F(x,y,z) = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z}
$$

â€¦defined at all points at which all the indicated [[Partial Derivative|partial derivatives]] exist.

Divergence tells us _how much_ the [[Vector|vectors]] in the vector field "grow" or "shrink".

When the divergence of a vector field is $0$, we say that the vector field is _incompressible_.
