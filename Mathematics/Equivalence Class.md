_**(definition)**_

Let $R$ be an [[Equivalence Relation|equivalence relation]] in $A$. We define the _equivalence class_ of $a \in A$:

$$
[a] = \{ x \in A \mid x R a \}
$$

> [!example]- Example 1
> Let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and…
>
> $$
> R = \{(1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (4,2), (4,4), (5,1), (5,3), (5,5) \}
> $$

> …be an equivalence relation.
>
> For each $a \in A$, we have that:
>
> - $[1] = \{1, 3, 5\} = [3] = [5]$
> - $[2] = \{2, 4\} = [4]$
>
> Notice that the equivalence classes of the elements in a given equivalence class are all the same.

> [!example]- Example 2
> Let $A = \{a, b, c\}$ and $R = \{(a,a), (b,b), (c,c)\}$ be an equivalence relation.
>
> We have that:
>
> - $[a] = \{a\}$
> - $[b] = \{b\}$
> - $[c] = \{c\}$
