_**(definition)**_

Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be [[Graph|graphs]].

We define the _sum_ of both graphs, denoted $G_1 + G_2$, as the [[Union of Graphs|union of both graphs]], with additional [[Edge|edges]] that connect all the [[Vertex|vertices]] of $G_1$ to all the ones of $G_2$.

> [!warning]- Obligatory Connections
> A new edge must be created between _all_ of the vertices of $G_1$ and _all_ the ones of $G_2$, even if they were already connected in one of the graphs.
