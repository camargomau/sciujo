_**(definition)**_

Given a [[Stochastic Process|stochastic process]] with $m$ [[State Set|possible states]], we can define an **initial probability vector** $a$:

$$
a = (a_{0}, a_{1}, \dots, a_{m})
$$

â€¦where $a_{i}$ denotes the probability of the initial state being $s_{i}$. 

> [!example]-
> For instance, let's say we have the stochastic process of tossing a coin and noting when we get heads or when we get tails. This process has a simple state set of $S = \left( \text{heads}, \text{tails} \right)$.
> 
> The initial probability vector of this process is $a = \left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$, since the probability of getting _either_ heads or tails is $\frac{1}{2}$.
