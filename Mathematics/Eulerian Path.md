_**(definition)**_

In a [[Graph|graph]] $G$, an _Eulerian path_ is a [[Path|path]] that contains all the [[Edge|edges]] in $G$ exactly once.

When $G$ has such a path, we say that it is an _Eulerian graph_.

> An _Eulerian tour_ (or _circuit_) is a closed Eulerian path.

_**(theorem)**_

The following statements are equivalent for a [[Connected Graph|connected graph]] $G$:

- $G$ is Eulerian
- The degree of every [[Vertex|vertex]] in $G$ is even
