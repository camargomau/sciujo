_**(definition)**_

A _complete bipartite graph_ is a [[Bipartite Graph|bipartite graph]] whose [[Vertex|vertices]] in one of the subsets of the bipartition are joined to all the vertices in the other subset of the bipartition.

Every complete bipartite graph that has $m$ vertices in one of the subsets of the bipartition and $n$ vertices in the other one is denoted by $K_{m,n}$.
