_**(definition)**_

In a [[Graph|graph]], the points that represent elements are called vertices or nodes. The set of vertices in a graph, commonly denoted by $V$, must be non-empty.

An [[Edge|edge]] joins two vertices. Vertices have [[Open Neighbourhood|open]] and [[Closed Neighbourhood|closed neighbourhoods]].

> [!info] Adjacency and Neighbours
> When a vertex $v_1$ is joined to another vertex $v_2$ by means of an edge, we say that they're _adjacent_ and that $v_1$ is a neighbour of $v_2$.

# Types

An _isolated vertex_ is a vertex with [[Vertex Degree|degree]] 0.

A _hanging vertex_ is a vertex with degree 1.
