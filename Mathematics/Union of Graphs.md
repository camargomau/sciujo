_**(definition)**_

Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be [[Graph|graphs]] with [[Vertex|vertex]] sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ and [[Edge|edge]] sets $E_1$ and $E_2$ respectively.

We define the _union_ of both graphs, denoted $G_1 \cup G_2$, as the graph that consists of the vertex set $V_1 \cup V_2$ and edge set $E_1 \cup E_2$.

Compare the [[Intersection of Graphs|intersection of graphs]].
