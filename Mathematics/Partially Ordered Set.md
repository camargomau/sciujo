_**(definition)**_

A [[Set|set]] $A$ with an [[Order Relation|order relation]] $\preceq$ is called a _partially ordered set_ (or _poset_, for short).

Posets have [[Minimal and Maximal|minimal and maximal elements]]. Subsets of posets have [[Upper and Lower Bounds|upper and lower bounds]]. The [[Supremum and Infimum]] and the [[Minimum and Maximum]] are specific cases of these bounds.
