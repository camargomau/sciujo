_**(definition)**_

Two [[Subgraph|subgraphs]] $g_1$ and $g_2$ of a [[Graph|graph]] $G$ are said to be _vertex-disjoint subgraphs_ (or _vertex-separate subgraphs_) if they don't share any [[Vertex|vertices]].

Every two vertex-disjoint subgraphs are also [[Edge-Disjoint Subgraphs|edge-disjoint subgraphs]].
