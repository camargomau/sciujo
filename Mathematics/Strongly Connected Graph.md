_**(definition)**_

We say that a [[Graph|graph]] is _strongly connected_ if we can go from one [[Vertex|vertex]] to any other, including itself, just by traversing an [[Edge|edge]]. Compare a [[Connected Graph|connected graph]].

A strongly connected graph is denoted with $FK_n$.

Between every pair of vertices in a strongly connected graph there is a [[Simple Trajectory|trajectory]] of length $1$.
