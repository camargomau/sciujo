_**(definition)**_

A _regular graph_ is a [[Simple Graph|simple graph]] whose vertices all have the same [[Vertex Degree|degree]].

> [!tip]- Simplices
> Notice that all $n$-[[Simplex|simplices]] are a regular graph of degree $n-1$.

# Number of Lines Theorem

_**(theorem)**_

Given a regular graph of [[Vertex Degree|degree]] $r$ with $n$ [[Vertex|vertices]], the number of lines is given by:

$$
\frac{nr}{2}
$$
