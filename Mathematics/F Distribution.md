_**(definition)**_

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[Event Independence|independent]] [[Random Variable|random variables]] such that $X \sim \chi_{(v_{1})}$ and $Y \sim \chi_{(v_{2})}$. Let:

$$
F = \frac{\frac{X}{v_{1}}}{\frac{Y}{v_{2}}}
$$

In such a case, we say that $F$ has an _F distribution_ and write $F \sim F_{(v_{1}, v_{2})}$.
