_**(definition)**_

Let $G$ be a [[Graph|graph]] with two [[Vertex|vertices]] $v_i$ and $v_j$ connected by an [[Edge|edge]] $e_k$.

The _graph fusion_ of $G$ relative to $e_k$ (denoted $G / e_k$) is the graph that results from:

1. Removing $e_k$.
2. Adding a new vertex $v_i v_j$ that is connected to all the vertices that $v_i$ and $v_j$ were individually connected to.
3. Removing $v_i$ and $v_j$.
