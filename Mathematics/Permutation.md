In mathematics, a _permutation_ is a selection of items from a set with distinct members, such that the order of selection matters.

When we do not care about the order of selection, then we have a [[Combination|combination]].

We can have permutations [[Permutations with no Repetitions|without repetitions]], [[Permutations with Repetitions|with repetitions]] and [[Permutations with Groups of Equal Elements|with groups of equal elements]].
