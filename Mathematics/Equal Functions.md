_**(definition)**_

Let $f, g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. We say that these two [[Function|functions]] are equal in $a \in \mathbb{R}$ up to $n$ order if:

$$
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)-g(x)}{(x-a)^n} = 0
$$

_**(theorem)**_ ^3a43d6

Let $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be [[Differentiability|differentiable]] $n$ times with a continuous derivative in $a \in \mathbb{R}$.

Then, $f$ and $P_f(n, a)$ (its [[Taylor Polynomial|Taylor polynomial]]) are equal up to the $n$ order.

_**(theorem)**_ ^94dcde

If $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are degree $n$ [[Polynomial|polynomials]] and they're equal in $a \in \mathbb{R}$ up to $n$ order, then they're actually the same polynomial.
