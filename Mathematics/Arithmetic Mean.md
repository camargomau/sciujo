_**(definition)**_

Let $x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}$ be observations ([[Random Variable Realisation|realisations]]) of a [[Variable (Statistics)|variable]] $X$.

The _arithmetic mean_ consists in the sum of all values divided by the amount of values:

$$
\mathrm{Mean}(X) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i}}{n} = \frac{x_{1} + \dots + x_{n}}{n}
$$

It is also possible to calculate the arithmetic mean when our data [[Weighted Mean|has weights]] or is [[Median for a Set of Frequencies|a table of frequencies]] or is [[Arithmetic Mean for Grouped Data|grouped in classes]].

# Properties

Let $x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}$ be observations of a [[Variable (Statistics)|variable]] and let $c$ be a constant. Then:

- $\mathrm{Mean}(cX) = c\ \mathrm{Mean}(X)$
- $\mathrm{Mean}(X+c) = \mathrm{Mean}(X) + c$
