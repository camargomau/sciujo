_**(definition)**_

The _inverse relation_ of a [[Relation|relation]], denoted $R^{-1}$, is defined as:

$$
R^{-1} = \{ (y,x) \mid (x,y) \in R \}
$$

# Properties

Bearing in mind the [[Domain and Range of a Relation|domain and range of a relation]], as well as the [[Cartesian Product|Cartesian product]], the inverse relation has the following properties:

- $R^{-1} \subseteq \text{ran} \times \text{dom}(R)$
- $(A \times B)^{-1} = B \times A$
- $\varnothing^{-1} = \varnothing$
