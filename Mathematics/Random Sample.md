_**(definition)**_

A _random sample_ is a collection of [[Random Variable|random variables]] $X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}$ that satisfy the condition of being [[Event Independence|independent]] and having all the same [[Distribution Function|distribution]] (i.e. they're [[Independent and Identically Distributed Random Variables|iid]]).

Random samples are used to formalise the concept of sampling a phenomenon whose behaviour is dictated by a random variable. Observing (i.e. obtaining [[Random Variable Realisation|realisations]]) a random variable $X$ $n$ times is equivalent to observing the random sample $X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}$ just once.
