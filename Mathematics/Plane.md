Let $P = (P_1, P_2, P_3)$ be a [[point]] in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $u = (u_1, u_2, u_3), v = (v_1, v_2, v_3)$ be [[linearly independent]] [[Vector|vectors]] in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

For relationships between planes and points, refer to [[Planes and Points]].

# Representations

## Vectorial Representation

In its vectorial representation, the plane that passes through $P$ and is generated by $u$ and $v$ is the set:

$$
\Pi := \{ P + tu + sv : t, s \in \mathbb{R} \}
$$

## Parametric Representation

In its parametric representation, the plane that passes through $P$ and is generated by $u$ and $v$ is:

$$
\Pi = \begin{cases}
x = P_1 + su_1 + tv_1 \\
y = P_2 + su_2 + tv_2 \\
z = P_3 + su_3 + tv_3
\end{cases}
$$

## Normal Representation

In its normal representation, the plane that passes through $p$ and is generated by $u$ and $v$ is:

$$
\Pi = \{ q \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid n \cdot (q - p) = 0 \}
$$

â€¦where $n = u \times v$ is the plane's [[Normal Vector|normal vector]], and $q$ is any point such that the equation is satisfied.

## Equation

All planes have an associated linear equation with three variables:

$$
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0
$$
