_**(definition)**_

An _event_ is a [[Subset|subset]] of a [[Sample Space|sample space]] $\Omega$, where we can say whether an [[Experiment|experiment]] is done or not.

Events are denoted by uppercase letters of the Latin [[alphabet]]:

$$
A, B, C, D, E, \dots \subseteq \Omega
$$

# Types

Let $A$ and $B$ be two events. We say that:

- $A$ is an impossible event if $A = \varnothing$
- $A$ is certain if $A = \Omega$
- $A$ and $B$ occur if $A \cap B$
- $A$ or $B$ occur if $A \cup B$
- $A$ occurring implies that $B$ occurs if $B \subseteq A$
- $A$ and $B$ are disjoint or mutually exclusive events if $A \cup B = \varnothing$
