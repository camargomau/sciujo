The _relative [[Error|error]]_ normalises the error to the true value. It's given by:

$$
E_{r} = \frac{|x-x_n|}{|x|}
$$

â€¦where $x$ is the exact value we're trying to approximate to, while $x_n$ is our last approximation.

Compare the [[Absolute Error|absolute error]].

> This can only be done with [[Convergence Order of a Numerical Method|convergent numerical methods]], since this ensures our last approximation is better than the one before.

# Relative Porcentual Error

The relative error can also be given the in a percentage ($E_r$%):

$$
\% E_{r} = \frac{|x-x_n|}{|x|}\ 100\%
$$
