_**(definition)**_

A _path_ is a finite sequence of alternated [[Vertex|vertices]] and [[Edge|edges]]. It starts on a specific vertex, and each one of the edges in a path must incide on the vertices that precede and supersede it. Vertices and arcs may be repeated; loops are also allowed.

As its names suggests, a path describes a path that can be followed on a specific graph.

There are [[Types of Paths|several types of paths]].
