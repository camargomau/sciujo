[[Stochastic Process|Stochastic processes]] can be classified:

- According to the structure of their sets ([[State Set|state set]] $S$ and [[Parameter Set|parameter set]] $T$).
- According to the [[Probability|probabilistic]] features of the [[Random Variable|random variable]].

# According to the Structure of their Sets

| $S$ / $T$  | Discrete                                                       | Continuous                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Discrete   | [[Chain]]                                                      | [[Point Process\|Point process]]           |
| Continuous | [[Sequence of Random Variables\|Sequence of random variables]] | [[Continuous Process\|Continuous process]] |

# According to the Probabilistic Features of the Random Variable $X_{t}$

If a stochastic process has a discrete parameter set and consists of independent random variables, then we have an [[Independent Trial Process|independent trial process]].

When a stochastic process satisfies the [[Markov Property|Markov property]], we have a [[Markov Process|Markov process]]

When we have a stochastic process whose increments within any two random variables are independent, we have a [[Stochastic Process with Independent Increments|process with independent increments]].

If the probability distribution of the vector of random variables is the same for any value of $t$, then we have a [[Stationary Process|stationary process]].
