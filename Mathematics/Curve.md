_**(definition)**_

We call a function $\sigma : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ a _curve_.

> [!example]- Example 1
> Let $\sigma : [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$ be defined by $\sigma(t) = (t,t)$.
>
> For instance, we have that two points in that curve are:
>
> $$
> \sigma(0) = (0,0)
> $$
> $$
> \sigma(1) = (1,1)
> $$
>
> This curve looks like:

> [!example]- Example 2
> Let $\sigma : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be given by $\sigma(t) = (t, t^{2})$.
>
> This curve looks like:

> [!example]- Example 3
> Let $\sigma : [-\pi, 5 \pi] \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$ be given by $\sigma(\theta) = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$.
>
> This curve is a circle.
