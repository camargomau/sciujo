There are several types of [[Digraph|digraphs]]:

- A [[Connected Digraph|connected digraph]] is a digraph where there exists a directed path between every pair of vertices.

- A [[Simple Digraph|simple digraph]] is a digraph with no loops and no parallel edges.

- An [[Asymmetric Digraph|asymmetric digraph]] is a digraph with more than one parallel edge, no loops and at least one non-recurring arc.

- A [[Symmetric Digraph|symmetric digraph]] is a digraph where there exists a pair of recurring arcs between every _connected_ pair of vertices.

- A [[Complete Digraph|complete digraph]] is a digraph where there exists a pair of recurring arcs between _every_ pair of vertices.

- A [[Regular Digraph|regular digraph]] is a digraph where every node has the same internal and external degrees.

- A [[Balanced Digraph|balanced digraph]] is a digraph where every vertex has the same internal and external degree.

- A [[Pseudodigraph|pseudodigraph]] is a digraph that has one or several arcs that join a vertex to itself (a loop arc).

- A [[Multidigraph|multidigraph]] is a digraph that can have parallel and recurring arcs, but must not have any loop arcs.
