_**(definition)**_

Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^n$. We say that $A$ is _closed_ if and only if $A^c$ (its [[Complement Set|complement]]) is [[Open Set|open]].

> Remember that a set being closed doesn't imply it's not open. Similarly, a set being open doesn't imply it's not closed.

> We have that $B^{c} = (\infty, 2) \cup [3, \infty)$. Notice that $B^c$ isn't open, so it follows that $B$ isn't closed.

> Notice that $B$ also isn't open (but this doesn't follow the closeness of $B^c$).

> [!example]- Example 3
> Let $C = (-\infty, 0)$.

> We have that $C^{c} = [0, \infty)$. Notice that $C^c$ isn't open, so it follows that $C$ isn't closed. However, do notice that $C$ is open.

# Union and Intersection

_**(corollary, from [[Open Set#Union and Intersection|this theorem]])**_

If $A$ and $B$ are closed, then $A \cup B$ and $A \cap B$ are also closed.

# Using the Limit Points of a Sequence

_**(lemma, from the definition of a [[Limit Point|limit point]])**_ ^3e2221

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$.

$A$ is [[Closed Set|closed]] if $\forall \text{ convergent } \{ a_{k} \} \subseteq A$ (a [[Sequence|sequence]]), the limit point of $a_k$ is in $A$.
