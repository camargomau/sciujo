A _box plot_ is a graph that shows the behaviour of a series of numerical data with the help of its [[Quantile|quartiles]].

# Elements

Box plots display data by summarising it with the following five elements:

- The _minimum_ (0th [[Quantile|percentile]]), the lowest data point in the dataset
- The _maximum_ (100th percentile), the highest data point in the dataset
- The _[[Median|median]]_, the middle value in the dataset
- The _first quartile_ (25th percentile), the median of the lower half of the dataset
- The _third quartile_ (75th percentile), the median of the upper half of the dataset

Box plots also use the [[Interquartile Range|interquartile ranges]] (IQR), which is the distance between the first and the third quartiles.
