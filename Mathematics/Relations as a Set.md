_**(definition)**_

A relation is a [[Set|set]] in which all pairs are ordered. When two elements of the set are related, we write $aRb$ or $(a,b) \in R$.

_**(definition)**_

Let $A, B$ be sets. A relation of $A$ in $B$ is a subset of $A \times B$ ([[Cartesian Product]]).

$R \text{ is a relation } \iff R \subseteq A \times B$

> [!example]-

> Let $C = \{ \text{capital cities of the world} \}$ and $A = \{ \text{countries of the world} \}$. Let $R$ be the relation where $x \in C$ is the capital city of $y \in A$. For instance:

> $(\text{CDMX}, \text{Mexico}) \in R$
> $\text{CDMX}\ R\ \text{Mexico}$
>
> â€¦but $(\text{Guadalajara}, \text{Mexico}) \notin R$.

> Note that that $\{ \text{All countries and its capital cities} \} \subseteq C \times A$. With this, we can say that that:

_**(lemma)**_ ^a3af3d

If $R$ is a relation, then $\{(y,x) \mid (x,y) \in R \}$ is also a relation.

> [!abstract]- Proof
> We have that $(y,x)$ is an ordered pair. Then, $\{(y,x) \mid (x,y) \in R \}$ is a set of ordered pairs. Therefore, it's a relation.
