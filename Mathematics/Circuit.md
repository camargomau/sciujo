_**(definition)**_

A _circuit_ is a closed [[Path|path]] where no edges are repeated and where the only [[Vertex|vertex]] that's repeated is the one that's at the start and at the end.

All the [[Vertex Degree|vertex degrees]] in a circuit are of at least 2.

A circuit is also known as a circular trajectory or polygon.

# Types of Circuits

A _directed circuit_ is a circuit that respects the direction of the [[Arc|arcs]] it goes through.
