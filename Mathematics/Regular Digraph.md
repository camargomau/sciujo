_**(definition)**_

A _regular digraph_ is a [[Digraph|digraph]] where every [[Vertex|vertex]] has the same [[Internal and External Degrees of a Vertex|external and internal degrees]].

If there are $n$ vertices, then there will be, at most, have $d^-(v) = d^+(v) = n-1$ for every vertex $v$ in a regular digraph.

A regular digraph is denoted by $(k, k)$, where $k$ is the internal and external degree of its vertices.
