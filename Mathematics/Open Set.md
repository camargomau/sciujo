_**(definition)**_

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$. We say that $A$ is an _open set_ if and only if $A = \text{int}(A)$. All of the points in A are [[Interior Point|interior]].

> [!tip]- Open does not imply not Closed
> Remember that a set being open doesn't imply it's not [[Closed Set|closed]]. Similarly, a set being closed doesn't imply it's not open.

# Union and Intersection

_**(theorem)**_

Let $A$ and $B$ be two open [[Set|sets]], then $A \cup B$ is open and $A \cap B$ is also open ([[Union|union]] and [[Intersection|intersection]]).

From this theorem, it also follows that if $A$ and $B$ are closed, then [[Closed Set#Union and Intersection|their union and intersection are also closed]].
