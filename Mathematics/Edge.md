_**(definition)**_

In a [[Graph|graph]], the lines that join its [[Vertex|vertices]] are called _edges_. Each edge has a set of one or two associated vertices, which are called _final nodes_ or terminal vertices_.

The set of edges in a given graph can be empty. An edge that joins the same vertex is called a _loop_.

> [!info] Adjacency and Incidency
> When two edges share a [[Vertex|vertex]], we say that they are _adjacent_.
>
> When a vertex $v$ is a final node of an edge $v$, we say that _$e$ incides on $v$_.

> [!info]- Serial Edges
> Two edges are _serial_ if they are adjacent and their shared [[Vertex|vertex]] has a [[Vertex Degree|degree]] of 2.

# Direction

Edges can be of two types: undirected or directed (also known as [[Arc|arcs]]). Directed edges have a direction, while undirected edges do not.

An example of an undirected edge is:

An example of a directed edge is:
