_**(definition)**_

The **unit step function** is defined as:

$$
u(t) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } t \leq 0 \\
1 & \text{if } t > 0
\end{cases}
$$

In other words, the unit step function is a [[Function|function]] that returns $0$ when its argument is non-positive, and $1$ when it is positive. Sometimes $<, \geq$ are used instead of $\leq, >$.

We can [[Shifted Unit Step Function|shift this function]] so that it's centred around a number other than $0$.
