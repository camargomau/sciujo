> _Kurtosis_ comes from from Greek κυρτός (kyrtos), which means "curved, arching".

_**(definition)**_

Let $x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}$ be observations of a [[Variable (Statistics)|variable]] $X$. The _kurtosis_ of $X$ is defined as:

$$
\begin{align*}
k(X) &= \frac{1}{s^4} \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_{i} - \overline{X} \right)^4 \right] \\[0.5em]
&= \frac{m_{4}}{(m_{2})^2}
\end{align*}
$$

(see [[Moment#As a Measure of Shape|moment as a measure of shape]])

Kurtosis describes how arched the variable's mass is. See [[Excess Kurtosis#Meaning|excess kurtosis's meaning]] for more details.
