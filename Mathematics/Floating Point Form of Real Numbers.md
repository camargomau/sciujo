The floating point form of a number in its [[Normalised Form of Real Numbers|normalised form]] can be obtained by terminating the fractional part of the number at $k$ digits. There are two ways to do this:

- **Truncate:** the digits of the number up to the position that the [[Word (computer archihtecture)|word]] size allows (i.e. $k$)
- **Round:**
	- If $d^{k+1} \geq 5$, we add $1$ to $d^k$, "_rounding up_"
	- If $d^{k+1} < 5$, we ignore the digits from $k+1$ onward, "_rounding down_"

$k$ is dependant on the size of the [[Word (computer archihtecture)|computer word]].

# Bit Assignation and Range

Floating point numbers use specific bits of the [[Word (computer archihtecture)|computer word]] for specific purposes. Normally, there's 1 bit dedicated to the sign, several bits for the [[Exponent|exponent]], and some more for the [[Mantissa|mantissa]] (the fractional part of the number).

## Range and Exponent

The size of the word defines the range of the exponent of the floating point number:

| **Total digits** | **Range of the exponent**         | **Exponent**            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| $N = p + q + 1$      | $-(2^{p-1} - 1)$ to $2^{p-1}$ | $c - (2^{p-1} - 1)$ |

â€¦where:

- $p$: number of digits for the exponent
- $q$: number of digits for the mantissa
- $c$: decimal form of the number in the exponent part of the word

> [!warning]- Mantissa Bits
>
> Please note that the mantissa section of the word must **always** have $1$ in its first position (left to right). The mantissa section **cannot** be $0$ in total.

# Final Number

The final number as represented on the computer is given by:

$$
(-1)^{s} B^{e} (1 + f)
$$
â€¦where:

- $s$: the bit corresponding to the sign
- $e$: the exponent (i.e. $c - (2^{p-1} - 1)$)
- $f$: the decimal number in the mantissa section
- $B$: the base for the numbering system
