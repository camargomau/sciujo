_**(definition)**_

The _concatenation_ of two [[Path|paths]] $W_{1} = \left\{ v_{0}, e_{1}, v_{1}, \dots, e_{k}, v_{k} \right\}$ and $W_{2} = \left\{ v_{k}, e_{k+1}, v_{k+1}, \dots, e_{n}, v_{n} \right\}$ is the set:

$$
W_{1} \circ W_{2} = \left\{ v_{0}, e_{1}, v_{1} \dots, e_{k}, v_{k}, e_{k+1}, v_{k+1}, \dots, e_{n}, v_{n} \right\}
$$

Notice that the final vertex in $W_{1}$ is the initial one in $W_{2}$.
