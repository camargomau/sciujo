_**(definition)**_

We say a [[Stochastic Process|stochastic process]] is a **stationary process** when, for any $t_{1}, t_{2}, \dots, t_{n}$ ([[State Set|state set]]), the [[Probability Distribution|probability distribution]] of the vector $\left( X_{t}, X_{t_{2}}, \dots, X_{t_{n}} \right)$ is the same one for $\left( X_{t_{1} + h}, X_{t_{2} + h}, \dots, X_{t_{n} + h} \right)$, for any $h > 0$.

In other words, the distribution of the vector of random variables is the same for any value of $t$.
