_**(theorem)**_

When we have [[Data (Statistics)|data]] $X$ sorted in classes (groups), the [[Median|median]] can also be calculated with:

$$
\mathrm{Median}(X) = L_{i} + \left( \frac{ \frac{n}{2} - \sum f_{i} }{f_{\text{median}}} \right) c
$$

â€¦where:

- $L_{i}$ is the inferior limit of the class (group) that contains the median
- $n$ is the total frequency
- $\sum f_{i}$ is the sum all frequencies that are less than the median
- $f_{\text{median}}$ is the frequency of the class that contains the median
- $c$ is the length of the interval that contains the median
