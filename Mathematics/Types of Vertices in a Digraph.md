_**(definition)**_

In a [[Digraph|digraph]], [[Vertex|vertices]] can be of several types:

- We say that a vertex is _isolated_ if the sum of its [[Internal and External Degrees of a Vertex|external and internal degrees]] is equal to $0$.

- A _final_ (or _terminal_) vertex is a vertex whose external degree is $0$.

- An _initial_ vertex is a vertex whose internal degree is $0$ and whose external degree is not $0$.

- A [[Hanging Vertex|hanging vertex]] is a vertex whose sum of external and internal degrees is $1$.
