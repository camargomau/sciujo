_**(definition)**_

In a [[Tree|tree]], a _leaf vertex_ is a [[Vertex|vertex]] that is only connected to one [[Edge|edge]].

In the case of a directed tree, then a leaf vertex is a vertex whose [[Internal and External Degrees of a Vertex|external degree]] is $0$.

Leaf vertices are also called _terminal vertices_, _leaf nodes_ or _terminal nodes_.

Compare [[Branch Vertex|branch vertices]].
