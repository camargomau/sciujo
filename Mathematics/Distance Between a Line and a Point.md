Let $q \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $l_1 = \{p + tu \mid t \in \mathbb{R} \}$. The distance between $l_1$ and $q$, denoted by $\text{d}(l_1, q)$ is:

$$
\text{d}(l_1, q) = \frac{\| u \times (p-q) \|}{\| u \|}
$$

> [!tip]- Reasoning behind the formula

> The formula comes from the fact that the (shortest) distance $d(l_1, q)$ between a point and a line is the length of the segment that goes from the point to the line and is perpendicular to it.
>
> If we think of a vector that goes from $p$ to $q$ (i.e. $p-q$), then we can calculate this shortest distance by dividing the area of the parallelogram (generated by the $p-q$ vector and the line vector, $\| u \times (p-q) \|$) by the length of the line vector ($\| u \|$), because this shortest distance is the height of such parallelogram.

> [!tip]- If $u$ is a unit vector
> In the case that $u$, the defining vector for $l_1$, is a unit vector, then the distance between $l_1$ and $q$ becomes:

> \text{d}(l_1, q) = \| u \times (p-q)\|

> Notice that, if we set $v = p-q$, then this coincides with the area $\| u \times v \|$ of the [[Parallelogram Generated by Two Vectors|parallelogram]] generated by $u$ and $v$.
