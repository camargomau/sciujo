_**(definition)**_

A [[Relation|relation]] $R$ on a [[Set|set]] $A$ is said to be an _order relation_ if $R$ is [[Properties of Relations|reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive]].

If $(a,b) \in R$, then we will denote the relation by writing $a \preceq b$.

> [!example]- Examples
> - $(\mathbb{N}, \leq)$ is a [[Well-Ordered Set|well-ordered set]].
> - $(\mathbb{R}, \leq)$ is an ordered set.
> - $(A, \subseteq)$ is an ordered set ($A$ is a set).
> - $(\mathcal{P}(A), \subseteq)$ is an ordered set ($\mathcal{P}$ is the [[Power Set]] of $A$)

When we define an order relation on a given set $A$, we say that $A$ is a [[Partially Ordered Set|partially ordered set]]. When every pair in $A$ is [[Comparability|comparable]], then $\preceq$ is a [[Total Order Relation|total order relation]] and $A$ is a totally ordered set.
