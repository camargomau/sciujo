If $T$ is [[Bijective Linear Transformations|bijective]], then it's invertible and there exists an inverse transformation of $T$ denoted by $T^{-1}$.

If $T : V \rightarrow W$ is [[linear]], then $T^{-1} : W \rightarrow V$ is also linear.

If $T : V \rightarrow W$ is an [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]], then $T^{-1} : W \rightarrow V$ is also an isomorphism.
