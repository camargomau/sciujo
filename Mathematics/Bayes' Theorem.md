_**(theorem)**_

Let $(B_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a [[Partition of a Sample Space|partition of a sample space]] and let $A$ be an [[Event|event]]. Then:

$$
\mathbb{P}(B_i \mid A) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \mid B_i) \mathbb{P}(B_i)}{\mathbb{P}(A)}
$$

(see [[Conditional Probability|conditional probability]])

Basically, Bayes' theorem describes the [[Probability of an Event|probability of an event]] based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.
