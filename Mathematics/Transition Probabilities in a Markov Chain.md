**Topics:** [[Markov Chain]]

---

In a [[Markov Chain|Markov chain]], we say we _transition_ when we go from one state to another. The study probability of transitioning from one state to another is of special interest. 

We can define [[One Step Transition Probability|one step transition probabilities]], which are basically the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another in a single step. 

We can also define [[Stationary Transition Probability|stationary transition probabilities]], which show up when the transition probabilities in a Markov chain don't change across time.

The existence of stationary transition probabilities also allow us to define [[n Step Transition Probability|n step transition probabilities]]. 

All of these transition probabilities are actually [[Conditional Probability|conditional]] in the sense that they consider a specific present state. We can additionally obtain the [[Unconditional Transition Probability|unconditional transition probabilities]], which are the probabilities of reaching a given state with no other condition specified.
