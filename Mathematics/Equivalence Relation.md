_**(definition)**_

A [[Relation|relation]] in a [[Set|set]] $A$ is an _equivalence relation_ if it satisfies the following [[Properties of Relations|properties]]:

- It's reflexive
- It's symmetric
- It's transitive

We denote an equivalence relation with $\sim$.

> - Symmetric, since if $x^{2} = y^{2}$, then $y^{2}= x^{2}$
> - Transitive, since if $x^{2} = y^{2}$ and $y^{2}=z^{2}$, then $x^{2}=z^2$
>
> Therefore, $R$ is an equivalence relation
