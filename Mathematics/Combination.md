**Topics:** [[Combinatorics]]

In mathematics, a _combination_ is a selection of items from a [[Set|set]] with distinct members, such that **the order of selection is irrelevant**.

When we do care about the order of selection, then we have a [[Permutation|permutation]].

We can calculate the [[Number of Combinations|number of combinations]] of $k$ elements in a given set of $n$ elements.
