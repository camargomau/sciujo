_**(definition)**_

Let $Z_{1}, \dots, Z_{k}$ be [[Random Variable|random variables]] with a [[Standard Normal Distribution|standard normal distribution]]. Let:

$$
X = Z_{1}^2 + \dots + Z_{k}^2
$$

In such a case, we say that $X$ follows a _chi-squared distribution_ with $k$ [[Degree of Freedom|degrees of freedom]] and write $X \sim \chi_{(k)}^2$.

# Expected Value and Variance

_**(theorem)**_

A random variable $X$ such that $X \sim \chi_{(k)}^2$ has an [[Expected Value|expected value]] and [[Variance|variance]] of:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = k
$$

$$
\mathrm{Var}(X) = 2k
$$
