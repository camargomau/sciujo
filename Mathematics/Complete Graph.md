_**(definition)**_

A _complete graph_ is a [[Simple Graph|simple graph]] such that every pair of [[Vertex|vertices]] is joined by an [[Edge|edge]]. As such, we can say that every pair of vertices is adjacent.

We denote a complete graph with $K_n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices.

> [!info]- Number of Lines
> A $K_n$ graph has exactly $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges.

> [!tip]- Simplices
> Notice that every $n$-[[Simplex|simplex]] is a $K_{n+1}$ complete graph.
