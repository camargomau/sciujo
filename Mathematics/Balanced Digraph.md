_**(definition)**_

A _balanced digraph_ is a [[Digraph|digraph]] where every [[Vertex|vertex]] has the same [[Internal and External Degrees of a Vertex|external and internal degrees]]. The degrees of the various vertices may differ.

All [[Regular Digraph|regular digraphs]] are balanced, but not all balanced digraphs are regular.
