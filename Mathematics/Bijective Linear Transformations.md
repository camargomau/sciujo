If a [[Linear Transformation|linear transformation]] $T : V \rightarrow W$ is [[Injective Linear Transformation|injective]] and [[Surjective Linear Transformations|surjective]], then it is bijective.

If $T$ is [[Bijective Linear Transformations|bijective]], then we call it an [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]] and it's [[Inverse Linear Transformation|invertible]].

# Equivalences

The following statements are [[equivalent]]:

1. $T$ is bijective
2. For all [[basis|bases]] $\beta$ of $V$, $T(\beta$) is a basis of $W$
3. There exists a basis $B_0$ of $V$ such that $T(B_0)$ is a [[generating set]] for $W$ (dubious)
