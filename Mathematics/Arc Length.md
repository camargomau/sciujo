_**(theorem)**_

Let $\sigma$ be a [[Curve|curve]] that is drawn by the following [[Vector-Valued Function|vector-valued function]]:

$$
r(t) = \langle x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), \dots, x_{n}(t)\rangle
$$

The _arc length_ of $\sigma$ is given by:

$$
s = \int_a^b \sqrt{[x_1'(t)]^2 + [x_2'(t)]^2 + \dots + [x_n'(t)]^2} \ dt
$$

We can use arc length to [[Arc Length Parameter|parametrise a function nicely]].
