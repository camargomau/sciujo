_**(definition)**_

In a [[Graph|graph]]. the _length between two vertices_ $v_i$ and $v_j$ is the amount of [[Edge|edges]] in the shortest [[Path|path]] that goes from one vertex to the other. In other words, it is the minimum amount of edges that must be traversed to reach one vertex from the other.

This is denoted by $d(v_i, v_j)$.
