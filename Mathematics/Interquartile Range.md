_**(definition)**_

The _interquartile range_ (or _IQR_ for short, _RIC_ in Spanish) is defined as:

$$
\mathrm{IQR} = q(0.75) - q(0.25)
$$

â€¦where $q(0.75)$ and $q(0.25)$ are the variable's [[Quantile|third and first quartiles]], respectively.

In other words, the IQR is the distance between a variable's first and third quartiles. The IQR is widely used in [[Box Plot|box plots]].
