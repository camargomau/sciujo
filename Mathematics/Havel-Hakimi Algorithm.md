The _Havel-Hakimi algorithm_ is an algorithm that lets us know if there exists a [[Simple Graph|simple graph]] whose [[Vertex Degree|degree sequence]] is a given [[Increasing and Decreasing Sequence|non-increasing]] [[Sequence|sequence]] of non-negative [[Integer|integers]].

The algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Take the first greatest integer. Let $n$ be this value.
2. Remove $n$ from the sequence
3. Subtract $1$ from the next $n$ integers.
4. Reorder the sequence so that it is non-increasing again.
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until we reach a sequence that consists of all zeroes or we get a negative integer.

When the resulting sequence consists of all zeroes, the sequence corresponds to a simple graph and we say that it is a _graphic_ sequence. Otherwise, the sequence doesn't correspond to a simple graph and we say that it is _non-graphic_.
