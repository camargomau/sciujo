_**(definition)**_

We say that two [[Graph|graphs]] $G$ and $G'$ are _isomorphic_ if:

1. Their number if [[Vertex|vertices]] is the same.
2. Their number of [[Edge|edges]] is the same.
3. The connections between all their edges and vertices are the same.
4. Their [[Vertex|hanging vertices]] are the same.

Isomorphic graphs may be represented graphically in different ways, so they may not seem isomorphic at first glance.

# Digraphs

Similarly, two [[Digraph|digraphs]] are isomorphic if their [[Subjacent Graph|subjacent graphs]] are isomorphic and the direction of all their [[Arc|arcs]] are the same.
