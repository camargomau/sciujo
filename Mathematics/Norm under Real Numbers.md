In $\mathbb{R}^n$ ([[Real Numbers as a Vector Space|as the usual vector space]]), we define the [[Norm]] of a vector $u = (u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n)$ as:

$$
\| u \| = \sqrt{u^2_1 + u^2_2 + \dots + u^2_n}
$$

This norm satisfies the previous properties. Also note that $\| u \|^2 = \langle u, u \rangle$.

Thanks to the [[Law of Cosines|law of cosines]], we also have that:

$$
\langle u, v \rangle = \| u \| \cdot \| v \| \cos \theta
$$
