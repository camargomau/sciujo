_**(definition)**_

An [[Ergodic Set|ergodic set]] with a single element is called an **absorbing set**. This single element of an absorbent set is called an **absorbing state**. 

It is called so because once we reach such a state, it _absorbs_ the process and it will remain there forever. 

A [[Markov Chain|Markov chain]] whose every non-[[Transitory Set|transitory state]] is absorbing is also said to be [[Absorbing Markov Chain|absorbing]].

_**(observation)**_

Note that a state $k$ is absorbing if $p_{kk} = 1$.
