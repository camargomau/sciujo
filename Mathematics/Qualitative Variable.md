In statistics, a _qualitative variable_ is a [[Variable (Statistics)|variable]] that describes the quality of something, rather than [[Quantitative Variable|quantities]].

In [[Descriptive Statistics|descriptive statistics]], qualitative variables can be:

- _Ordinal_, where an [[Order Relation|order relation]] can be established (e.g. the satisfaction level of a client.
- _Nominal_, which simply use nouns (e.g. the birthplace of a person).
