_**(definition)**_

Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be [[Graph|graphs]] with [[Vertex|vertex]] sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ and [[Edge|edge]] sets $E_1$ and $E_2$ respectively.

We define the _intersection_ of both graphs, denoted $G_1 \cap G_2$, as the graph that consists of the vertex set $V_1 \cap V_2$ and edge set $E_1 \cap E_2$.

$G_1 \cap G_2$ is a [[Subgraph|subgraph]] of both graphs.

Compare the [[Union of Graphs|union of graphs]].
