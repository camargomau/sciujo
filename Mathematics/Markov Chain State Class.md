_**(definition)**_

Given a [[Markov Chain|Markov chain]] with its respective [[State Set|states]], which can [[State Communication|communicate]] with other states or not, we can create classes that group _all_ states that communicate.

When a given chain has only one class, then the class is an [[Ergodic Set|ergodic set]], all of its states communicate and thus the chain is [[Ergodic Markov Chain|ergodic (or irreducible)]].
