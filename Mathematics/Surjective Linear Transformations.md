Let $T : V \rightarrow W$ be [[linear]].

$T$ is [[surjective]] if $\text{im}(T) = W$.

That is, if $T$ is surjective, then $\forall\ w \in W$ there exists $v \in V$ such that $T(v) = w$.

# Equivalences

The following statements are [[equivalent]]:

1. $T$ is surjective
2. $\forall$ set $A$ that [[spans]] $V$ ($\text{span}(A) = V$) $\implies \text{span}(T(A)) = W$
3. There exists a set $A_0$ that spans $V$ such that $T(A_0)$ spans $W$ (dubious)
