The _addition principle_ is a basic [[Counting Principle|counting principle]].

Intuitively, it tells us that if a situation can occur in $k$ different ways, and another situation (exclusive from the first one) can occur in $n$ different ways, then there are $n + k$ ways in which the first situation **or** the second one can occur.

Mathematically, if $A$ and $B$ are two finite [[Disjoint Set|disjoint sets]], then:

$$
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|
$$
