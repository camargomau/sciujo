_**(definition)**_

A _Bernoulli trial_ is an [[Experiment|experiment]] that can have two possible results: **success** or **failure**. That is, $\Omega = \{ \text{success}, \text{failure} \}$.

We normally call $p$ the [[Probability of an Event|probability]] of success.

Bernoulli trials are carried out in random variables with a [[Bernoulli Distribution|Bernoulli distribution]] or a [[Binomial Distribution|binomial distribution]].
