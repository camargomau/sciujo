_**(definition)**_

A _complete digraph_ is a [[Digraph|digraph]] where, between every pair of [[Vertex|vertices]], there exists an [[Arc|arc]] in both directions. A complete digraph must not have any loops.

A complete digraph is denoted with $DK_n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices.

All complete digraphs are [[Symmetric Digraph|symmetric]], but not all symmetric digraphs are complete.

# Number of Vertices and Arcs

In a complete digraph with $n$ vertices, there will be $n(n-1)$ arcs.

Every vertex $v$ in a complete digraph will have $d^-(v) = n-1 = d^+(v)$ (see [[Internal and External Degrees of a Vertex|external and internal degrees]]).
