_**(definition)**_

Let $(X, \preceq)$ be a [[Partially Ordered Set|poset]] and let $B \subseteq X$.

- An element $a \in X$ is an _upper bound_ for $B$ if $b \preceq a$ $\forall b \in B$
- An element $c \in X$ is a _lower bound_ for $B$ if $c \preceq b$ $\forall b \in B$

We use upper and lower bounds to define the [[Supremum and Infimum|supremum and infimum of a subset]], as well as the [[Minimum and Maximum|minimum and maximum]] of said subset.
