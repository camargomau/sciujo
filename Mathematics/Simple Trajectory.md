_**(definition)**_

A _simple trajectory_ is an [[Path|open path]] where no [[Vertex|vertices]] or [[Edge|edges]] are repeated. Loops can't be included, since that would imply a repeated vertex.

A simple trajectory is always a path, but a path is not always a simple trajectory.

# Types of Trajectories

A _directed trajectory_ is a trajectory that respects the direction of the [[Arc|arcs]] it goes through.
