_**(definition)**_

A _simple graph_ is a [[Graph|graph]] that has no loops or multi-edges.

This is the type of graph we'll simply call a _graph_. When we refer to [[Types of Graphs|other types]] of graphs, we will specify them.

_**(theorem)**_

A simple non-trivial graph must have at least two [[Vertex|vertices]] whose degrees are the same.
