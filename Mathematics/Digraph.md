_**(definition)**_

A _digraph_ is a [[Graph|graph]] where all of its [[Edge|edges]] are directed (i.e. they are all [[Arc|arcs]]).

There are [[Types of Digraphs|several types of digraphs]] (ðŸ—º).

# Digraphs and Relations

We can graphically represent a given a [[Relation|relation]] $R$ in $A$ with a _digraph_.

A digraph is made out of the following elements:

- **Vertices:** each vertex is an element of $A$
- **Arcs**: if $(x,y) \in R$, an arc is drawn from the vertex of $x$ to the vertex of $y$
	- If $(x,x) \in R$, then we draw a curved arc from $x$ to itself; we call this a [[Loop|loop]].

We can use digraphs to [[Properties of Relations in their Representations|easily determine the properties of the relation]].
