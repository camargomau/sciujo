In graph theory, the _degree_ of a [[Vertex|vertex]] is defined as the amount of [[Edge|edges]] that incide on it. The degree of a vertex $v$ is denoted $d(v)$.

> [!info] Loops
> Note that loops have two degrees, since one same edge incides twice on the same vertex.

We denote the minimum [[Vertex Degree|vertex degree]] in a graph with $\delta_{min}$ or $\delta$, and the maximum with $\delta_{max}$ or $\Delta$.

# Even Vertices, Odd Degrees

_**(corollary, from [[Handshaking Lemma|handshaking lemma]])**_

In a graph, when the sum of the even degrees is even, then it must hold that the amount of vertices with odd degrees is even.

# Odd Degree

_**(theorem)**_

In a graph with no loops, the number of vertices with an odd degree is even.
