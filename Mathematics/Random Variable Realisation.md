_**(definition)**_

The _realisation_ of a [[Random Variable|random variable]] is the value that is actually observed from it, the actual observation of what happened.

In other words, the realisation of a random variable is a _specific **value**_ $x \in \mathbb{R}$ that is returned by our random variable (a function $X : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$).

Random variables are denoted with uppercase letters (e.g. $X$), but their observations are denoted with lowercase letters (e.g. $x$).

[[Order Statistic|Realisations are used when ordering random variables]] when we collect them as [[Random Sample|random samples]].
