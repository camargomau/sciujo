_**(definition)**_

An **ergodic Markov chain**, also known as _irreducible_, is [[Markov Chain|Markov chain]] that only has _a single_ [[Markov Chain State Class|class]]. Since there is only one class, it follows that this class is an [[Ergodic Set|ergodic set]]. 

There are two types of ergodic Markov chains: [[Cyclical Markov Chain|cyclical]] and [[Regular Markov Chain|regular]] chains. The set of cyclical chains is the complement of the set of regular chains.
