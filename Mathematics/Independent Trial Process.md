_**(definition)**_

An **independent trial process** is a [[Stochastic Process|stochastic process]] of a discrete [[Parameter Set|parameter set]] that consists of [[Event Independence|independent]] [[Random Variable|random variables]].

This implies that the result of the process in any given moment is independent from any other past or future result in the process.
