A _stack_ is a [[Linear Data Structure|linear data structure]] in which we can only operate through one end (i.e. we can only insert or delete elements from one of its sides).

The elements in a stack are deleted in the order in which they were inserted; this is why stacks are also called _LIFO_-type structures (last in, first out).

Like [[List|lists]], stacks can be contiguous or linked. Stacks have the following operations:

1. Iteration through the stack
2. Element insertion (_push_)
3. Element deletion (_pop_)
4. Element search
