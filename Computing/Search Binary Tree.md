A _search binary tree_ is a special kind of [[Binary Tree|binary tree]] where insertion, deletion and search operations can be carried out in a fast and efficient way.

They're identical to the normal binary trees, except that the values in its nodes follow specific order rules. Given a value in a specific node:

- Every value that's less or equal to it is in the left branch of its node
- Every value that's greater than it is in the right branch of its node
