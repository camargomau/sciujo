A _list_ is a [[Linear Data Structure|linear data structure]] that contains a _variable_ number of elements that are related one to the other.

To iterate through the list, it is necessary to know where it begins and where it ends. Because of that, whenever we can reach the first element, we can also reach the rest of the elements.

Lists can be contiguous (i.e. an [[Array|array]]) or linked. Linked lists can be [[Simple Linked List|simple]] or [[Doubly Linked List|doubly linked]]. Lists have the following operations:

1. Iteration through the list
2. Element insertion
3. Element deletion
4. Element search
