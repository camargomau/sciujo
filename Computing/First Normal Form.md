When normalising a database, we say that a [[Relation|relation]] (table) is in the _first normal form_ (1NF) if it satisfies the following 3 conditions:

1. Each [[Attribute|attribute]] (column) is atomic. That is, it contains one and only one [[Attribute Value|value]] for each [[Tuple|tuple]].
2. The values stored in a given [[Attribute|attribute]] are of the same nature (same domain, same data type).
3. All the attributes have unique names
