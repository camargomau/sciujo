Given an [[IP Address]], to subnet is to borrow bits from the [[host]] portion of the address and use them to create [[Subnetwork|subnetworks]]. This allows us to increase the number of [[subnetworks]] and hosts within a specific IP address.

Subnetting can be carried out with [[Class B Subnetting|class B IP addresses]] and [[Class C Subnetting|class C IP addresses]].
