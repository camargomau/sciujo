In databases, an _attribute_ is a name paired with a data type. For instance, a [[Relation (database)|relation]] _person_ can have attributes _name_, _last name_, _date of birth_, etc.

No tuple can contain two attributes with the same name. An attribute paired with an element of its domain is called an [[Attribute Value|attribute value]].

When an attribute is not is any [[Candidate Key|candidate key]] of the relation, we call it a [[Non-Prime Attribute|non-prime attribute]].
