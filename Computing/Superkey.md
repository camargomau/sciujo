In databases, a _superkey_ is a [[Set|set]] of [[Attribute|attributes]] that **uniquely** identify each [[Tuple|tuple]] in a [[Relation (database)|relation]]. In other words, a superkey defines a [[Functional Dependency|functional dependency]] between it and the rest of the [[Attribute Value|attribute values]] in a given tuple.

A superkey can also be seen as a set of attributes that have a unique combination of values in each row.

Logically, tuples with the same superkey must also have the same non-key attribute values.

The [[Minimal and Maximal|minimal]] superkey is called a [[Candidate Key|candidate key]].
