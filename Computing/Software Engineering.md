_Software engineering_ is a concept that can be defined in three ways:

1. The establishment and usage of robust engineering principles that are oriented towards the development of cheap, reliable and efficient software that satisfies the needs of the client.

2. The discipline that encompasses all the aspects of software production, from the start of the project to the end.

3. The engineering discipline, application of theories, methods and tools that can be used to solve software-related problems, taking into consideration the organisational and financial restrictions.
