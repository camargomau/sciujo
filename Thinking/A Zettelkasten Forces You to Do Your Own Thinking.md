**Topics:** [[Zettelkasten]]

---

When taking notes that I know will go into my [[Zettelkasten]] ([[Scinoto]]), I very often find myself thinking and questioning the knowledge at hand, instead of just writing it and taking it for granted.

This is a natural consequence of the Zettelkasten method and it's one of its main strengths. Since linking is an essential process of a Zettelkasten, you are frequently forced to engage with what you're writing. You are forced to think about _how_ some new knowledge fits within the rest of your current knowledge; perhaps you've already written about it but from a different perspective, perhaps it's related to some other idea or concept.

This kind of thinking and engagement I'm frequently forced to do has [[The Value of a Zettelkasten in University|proved to be invaluable in university]].
