In the context of note-taking, the concept of _atomicity_ refers to the idea of a note dealing with one and only one thought or concept.

Such a note can be seen as an atom (hence the name) that can be put together with other atomic notes through note-taking techniques like [[Zettelkasten]]. When a note gets too big and it starts dealing with more than one thought or concept, it's generally a good idea to refactor (split) the note into two or more more atomic notes.
