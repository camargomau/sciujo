The more I got into muscle building and [[Learning How to Learn|learning how to learn]], the more I realised that they are one same thing.

I have found that, at least for me, the process consists of:

1. Going out of our comfort zone just enough for it to be a challenge, but not so much that it becomes impossibly hard.
2. Feeling (a healthy amount of) discomfort in the following hours/days.
3. Resting as to not overstrain.
4. Repeating from step 1.

With time and consistency, this expands our comfort zones and capabilities. Remember: [[Small Actions Compound Over Time]].
