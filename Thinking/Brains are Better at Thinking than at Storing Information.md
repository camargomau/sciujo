After being in contact with the note-taking community for quite some time now, the idea of _brains being better at thinking than at storing information_ seems to be frequent and recurring, and a very important one when it comes to note-taking systems like [[Zettelkasten|ZettelkÃ¤sten]].

It's true: we forget things everyday, but, in my experience, learning how to think is never forgotten. It is frequent that I find myself having an easier time remembering where and how to find certain things than remembering those things themselves. This is precisely the problem that many approaches to note-taking aim to solve: they provide a consistent and reliable place to find knowledge and information, leaving one's brain to only focus on thinking, hence why this kind of note sets are commonly called "second brains".
