A Zettelkasten isn't about taking notes for the sake of having them. A Zettelkasten isn't the goal itself, but the journey.

A Zettelkasten provides the means for better thinking. A Zettelkasten has the main purpose of aiding in the distillation, processing and recall of knowledge; the creation and tending of notes is just part of the process, _not_ the goal itself.

This is why [[Perfectionism Has No Place in a Zettelkasten]]; it distracts from the actual knowledge work.

This also goes in line with the idea that [[Notes in a Zettelkasten Have No Finished State]].
