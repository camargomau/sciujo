**Topics:** [[Zettelkasten]] - [[Note-taking]] - [[Perfectionism]]

I often fall into the trap of wanting to perfect a given note before formally considering it a part of my Zettelkasten.

Not only does this harm productivity ([[Productivity is Doing the Right Things in the Right Amounts of Time]]), but more importantly, it defeats two of the guiding principles of a Zettelkasten: [[A Zettelkasten is a Journey, Not a Destination]] and [[Notes in a Zettelkasten Have No Finished State]].

If a note is "perfect" from the get-go, then what is there to tend? What is there to add, to change, to improve upon?

Wanting to perfect notes in a Zettelkasten only adds a _huge_ amount of friction to the note-taking process, and remember: [[Writing in a Zettelkasten Should Be Frictionless]].
