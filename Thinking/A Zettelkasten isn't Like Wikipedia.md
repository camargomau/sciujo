**Topics:** [[Zettelkasten]] - [[Personal Knowledge Management]]

As a mathematician and a very fact-oriented person, I have fallen into the trap of constantly using my [[Zettelkasten]] (i.e. my [[Notkesto]]) as Wikipedia. Most (if not all) of the notes taken between May 2021 and October 2023 contain hard facts: definitions, concepts, methods, implementations, etc.

That approach has been effective for that kind of knowledge; particularly, it's been [[The Value of a Zettelkasten in University|invaluable in university]]. However, with time, I started to notice that my _personal_ ideas, thoughts and insight got lost and forgotten. All the connections and epiphanies I ever made with them were lost with the passage of time, and the fact that I stored these ideas mainly in [[Taglibro|my journal]] did not help at all. When rediscovering past journal entries, I would stumble upon insight and realise I had forgotten about it completely.

After thinking about how to tackle this problem, I quickly realised that I did not need any new and shiny solutions because I already had one: my Zettelkasten. I realised that I could also use it for _my own_ ideas, thoughts and insight, instead of just using it for facts and general concepts, which don't really belong to one same person. A Zettelkasten is a [[Personal Knowledge Management|Personal Knowledge Management]] system after all, is it not?

In summary, a Zettelkasten can not only be used to manage the knowledge that one _obtains_, but also the one that one _creates_.
