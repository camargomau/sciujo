**Topics:** [[Zettelkasten]]

If a Zettelkasten is to be used as a [[Second Brain]], then writing in it should be as frictionless as possible.

A Zettelkasten's main function is to aid in better thinking ([[A Zettelkasten is a Journey, Not a Destination]]), so any process that distracts from that ([[Perfectionism Has No Place in a Zettelkasten]], etc.) should be avoided or kept to a minimum.

Knowledge and insight should flow as freely from one's mind to the Zettelkasten as they flow within our mind.
