# Integral Transforms

An [[Integral Transform|integral transform]] is an operator that takes a set, a function to be operated and another _specific_ function (called the integral kernel), returning one more function that's obtained through integration. It's basically just integrating the product of a function by the integral kernel over a given set. 

## Laplace Transform

The [[Laplace Transform|Laplace transform]] is an integral transform whose integral kernel is $e^{-st}$ and integration interval is $[0, \infty)$. 

We can obtain the [[Laplace Transform of Simple Functions|Laplace transform of varios simple functions]] to facilitate other more complex transforms. Similarly, there are several [[Fundamental Theorems of the Laplace Transform|fundamental theorems]] that we can also use to our convenience. We can use one of them to easily obtain the Laplace transform of a piecewise function after having it [[Expressing a Piecewise Function with Shifted Unit Step Functions|rewritten in terms of shifted unit step functions]].

We can guarantee the existence of a Laplace transform by [[Laplace Transform Conditions of Existence|means of the consequences of two theorems]].
