# Unit 2

There is [[Continuous Function|a theorem]] that tells us whether a [[Vectorial Function|vectorial function]] is continuous in all of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ or not.

Vectorial functions [[Differentiable Vectorial Function|can be differentiated]]. Since vectorial functions have multiple [[Partial Derivative|partial derivatives]], it's convenient to place them all in a special matrix called a [[Jacobian Matrix|Jacobian matrix]].
