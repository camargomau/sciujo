# Unit 1: Systems Theory

[[Systems Theory|Systems theory]] is the interdisciplinary study of [[System|systems]]. A system is an interconnected set of components that, under certain rules, look to achieve one same goal.

In systems theory, there are several key concepts:

- [[Synergy]], which is the cooperative action of independent sub-systems.
- Having [[Recursivity (Systems Theory)|recursivity]] in a system means that every one of its components is independent and synergistic with each other.
- [[Homoeostasis]] is the level of response and adaptation to context that a system has.
- [[Semantics (Systems Theory)|Semantics]] is a set of new words derived from new specialisations.
- The wear and tear that a system suffers with time or as a byproduct of its own operation is known as [[Entropy (Systems Theory)|entropy]].
- The principle that establishes that a system and its components must achieve the same goal is known as [[Equifinality|equifinality]].

[[Operations Research|Operations research]] is the application of the scientific method to improve decision making, within the context of systems theory.

# Unit 2: Mathematical Models

A [[Mathematical Model|mathematical model]] is an abstract representation of a problem. Mathematical models can be:

- [[Normative Mathematical Model|Normative]], which describe a functional relation and prescribe a specific course of action.
- [[Descriptive Mathematical Model|Descriptive]]. which describe a functional relation but _don't_ prescribe any course of action.
- [[Deterministic Mathematical Model|Deterministic]], which means that all of its parameters are known.

A [[Linear Function|linear function]] is a type of function where sums and scalar products behave nicely. [[Linear Inequality|Linear inequalities]] are similar.

With these two, we can model a [[Linear Programming Problem|linear programming problem]] (LPP), which is basically a problem where the optimum (maximum or minimum) of a linear function is sought for. The correct and adequate modelling of an LPP is crucial for its optimisation and is an essential concept for this course.
