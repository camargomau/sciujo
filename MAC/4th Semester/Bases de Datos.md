A **[[Database|database]]** (🗺) is a collection of data that is organised structurally according to a specific well-defined set of rules.

[[Database Normalisation|Database normalisation]] is organising data in a database such that errors and anomalies are avoided. To normalise a database, we use the so-called _normal forms_:

1. The [[First Normal Form|first normal form]] requires all the attribute values to be atomic.
2. The [[Second Normal Form|second normal form]] requires to have no partial dependencies.
3. The [[Third Normal Form|third normal form]] requires to have no transitive dependencies.

A [[Foreign Key|foreign key]] is a [[Primary Key|primary key]] included within another table. We use foreign keys to relate tables between each other.
