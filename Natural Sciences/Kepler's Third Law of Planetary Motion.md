_Kepler's third [[Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion|law of planetary motion]]_ tells us that the square of a planet's [[Orbital Period|orbital period]] is proportional to the cube of the length of the [[Ellipse Axes|semi-major axis]] of its [[Orbit|orbit]].

Mathematically, given:

- $T$ the time required for a given planet to make one orbit around the Sun
- $2a$ the length of the major axis of its [[Ellipse|elliptical]] orbit

Kepler's third law tells us that $T^2 = ka^3$, for some constant $k$. That is, $T^2$ is proportional to $a^3$.
