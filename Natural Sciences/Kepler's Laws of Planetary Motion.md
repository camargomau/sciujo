_Kepler's laws of planetary motion_ are a set of [[Scientific Law|laws]], published by [[Johannes Kepler]] between 1609 and 1619, that describe the [[Orbit|orbits]] of [[Planet|planets]] around the [[Sun]].

There are three laws:

1. [[Kepler's First Law of Planetary Motion]]
2. [[Kepler's Second Law of Planetary Motion]]
3. [[Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion]]

Kepler's laws were formulated based on empirical observation and exhaustive analysis, but a few decades later, in 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] was able to prove them by means of [[Calculus|calculus]], his [[Newton's Second Law of Motion|second law of motion]] and his [[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation|law of universal gravitation]]. This work was published in the [[Principia Mathematica]].
