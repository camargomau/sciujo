In [[Systems Theory|systems theory]], _operations research_ is the application of the [[Scientific Method|scientific method]] by interdisciplinary teams to improve decision making.

Operations research uses the following methodology for problem solving:

1. Define and understand the problem thoroughly.
2. Build the mathematical model.
3. Solve the problem.
4. Analyse the results.
5. Verify the results.
6. Implement the model.

Notice that this is basically the scientific method applied to systems and their problems (cf. [[Scientific Method in Statistics]]).

> - Solving the problem, i.e. finding the optimal solution for it
> - Dissolving the problem, i.e. making the problem stand out less
